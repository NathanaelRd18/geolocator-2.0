Anwar, 56, who this week completed four years in prison on a corruption charge, now faces an earliest possible release date of April 14, 2009 if he is given one third remission of his sentence for good behaviour.

"We've made clear we're not going to pay for elimination of the nuclear weapons programs that never should have begun in the first place," he said.

The ruling Millennium Democratic Party (MDP), founded by former president Kim Dae-Jung, has suffered declining popularity since President Roh Moo-Hyun took office in February.	
A group of 18 reformist MDP lawmakers, mostly Roh's confidants, demanded late Wednesday that the party be "constructively dissolved" to create a new grouping, MDP officials said.	
But the established MDP leadership has opposed the sudden overhaul, they added.	
Reformist MDP members, however, vowed to launch a preparatory committee next month and to make "tangible progress" in the process of forging a new party.	
The internal dispute erupted after the MDP lost three parliamentary seats in Thursday's by-elections.	
The opposition Grand National Party (GNP) took two of the National Assembly seats while a splinter reformist party got the third.	
With the latest wins, the GNP increased its majority in the 272-seat National Assembly to 153 seats against 101 for the MDP.	
General elections are due in April next year.

TEHRAN , May 4 (AFP) The pro-reform director of Iran 's biggest-selling daily newspaper and official organ of Tehran 's municipality has stepped down following the appointment of a conservative as the city 's new mayor, press reports said Sunday.

Mohammad Atrianfar, who had headed Hamshahri (Fellow Citizen) since it was founded a decade ago and was a major backer of reformist President Mohammed Khatami, explained that he wanted to "leave the new mayor with a free hand to choose a director" of the paper.	
Tehran had been governed by reformists since 1989, but a conservative city council was elected in the February 28 municipal polls in a result attributed to a meager turnout amid growing public disillusionment with electoral politics.

Mahmud Ahmadi-Nejad, reported to be a hardliner among conservatives, was appointed mayor on Saturday and a change in Hamshahri's management -- as well as its editorial line -- has been considered inevitable given the election result.

"They have to get the green light from police.	
We have given an assurance that there will not be a huge crowd at the house as the guests will only comprise of family members," he added.	
The former deputy premier, sacked by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in 1998, was sentenced to a total 15 years in jail after being convicted of corruption and sodomy.	
He completed four years in prison on a corruption charge last month and is now serving a nine-year sodomy sentence.	
He lost an appeal case on his sodomy sentence on April 18.	
Another appeal is now pending in the Federal Court.	
Anwar, 56, says he was framed to prevent him from becoming a political threat to Mahathir, an allegation the government denies.	
 Budget cinema launched by eastJet founder finally gets some films

EasyCinema, which aims to sell tickets to its no-frills cinemas for as little as 20 pence (0.28 euros, 0.32 dollars), has been locked in a bitter battle with film distributors over how it wants to pay for titles.	
Rather than splitting ticket sales with distributors, easyCinema wants to pay a fixed fee for rights to show first-run movies over a fixed period, a proposal thus far rejected by the film majors.	
EasyCinema founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who set up easyJet in 1995 and built it up into Europe 's biggest budget airline, has vowed to take legal action against the distribution firms unless they allow him access.	
The deadlock, and subsequent lack of any films, has been threatening to de-rail the debut of easyCinema's first outlet in Milton Keynes , SIGNAL id="S-1" just north SIGNAL of London , which is due to open its doors on May 23.

Haji-Ioannou professed himself "delighted", but promised to push ahead in his battle with other distributors.	
"The situation with the top six UK distributors representing more than 90 percent of the market is still in a deadlock," he said.	UK PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-4" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
"I have instructed my lawyers to discuss this issue with the Office of Fair Trading." EasyCinema aims to make its money by drawing the public in with rock-bottom prices during off-peak hours, when traditional cinemas are often almost empty, also giving the biggest discounts to tickets bought long in advance.	
To cut costs, all booking is done via the Internet and the pared-down cinemas have no popcorn stalls and skeleton staff.

 MCI to pay huge fine to SEC for accounting fraud: report	
MCI, formerly WorldCom, and the Securities and Exchange Commission have reached a final agreement in the telecom giant's 11-billion-dollar (9.4-billion-euro) fraud case, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday.	Wall Street PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208991647" id="Pl-2" predicative="true" state="US-NY" type="ROAD"
Under terms of the agreement, to be submitted as early as Monday to a judge presiding over the case, MCI would agree to pay the largest fine imposed so far by the SEC on a company that is not a broker-dealer, the Journal said, citing sources close to the matter.	
The report did not give the amount of the fine, but said it would be "exponentially larger" than the historic 10 million dollars Xerox paid the SEC last year.	
Last month, the SEC slapped fines totaling 1.4 billion dollars on 10 Wall Street brokerages to settle charges of conflicts of interest between analysts and investors.	Wall Street PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208991647" id="Pl-2" predicative="true" state="US-NY" type="ROAD"
MCI and the SEC negotiated the agreement for months after a partial settlement in November under which MCI, formerly known as WorldCom, agreed not to mislead investors about its finances, and to improve internal controls, the Journal said.	
The estimated value of the fraud has reached historic proportions, swelling from the initially announced 3.5 million dollars to 11 million dollars as revelations of misconduct piled on, the report said.	
Separately, former WorldCom CEO Bernard Ebbers failed on April 29 to make a first repayment of 25 million dollars, plus interest, on a 400-million-dollar loan from MCI, the Journal said, citing SEC documents.	
Because he is now in default MCI must now seize additional assets owned by Ebbers, to secure the loan.	
The company has already sold his Georgia -based yacht building business for 15 million dollars, and is close to selling his ranch in British Colombia , which is expected to bring 60 to 70 million dollars, the Journal said.	ranch PLACE country="CA" form="NOM" id="Pl-6" state="CA-BC" type="FAC",British Colombia PLACE country="CA" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19438339" id="Pl-4" latLong="55.000°N 125.000°W" state="CA-BC" type="CIVIL",Georgia PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1706317" id="Pl-5" latLong="32.750°N 83.500°W" predicative="true" state="US-GA" type="CIVIL"

Shiites, who celebrate the birthday a week later than Sunni Muslims, were forbidden to publicly mark the date under the regime of Saddam Hussein's Sunni-dominated regime.

 Rachel Hunter seeks divorce from pop icon Rod Sewart -- finally	
Supermodel Rachel Hunter on Tuesday filed for divorce from her estranged rocker husband Rod Stewart, four years after the couple separated, court papers showed.	
Hunter, 34, filed for divorce in Los Angeles Superior Court, citing irreconcilable differences with the 58-year-old rock star to whom she has been married for nearly 13 years.

How the assets of the couple -- they have a daughter, Renee, 11, and a son, Liam, 8 -- will divided has yet to be decided, the documents showed.	
The celebrity couple spit up very publicly four years ago and each has since had well-publicized relationships with others.	
New Zealand -born Hunter reportedly had a fling with British pop star Robbie Williams, while British star Stewart has been much photographed with his reported girlfriend, blond photographer Penny Lancaster.

Stewart has said that after two failed marriages, he felt it unrealistic to expect couples to commit to each other for life and suggested that the words "til death do us part" should be removed from the wedding ceremony.	
Stewart's 1979 marriage to Alana Hamilton lasted five years and produced two children.

Another witness, Junaedi, alias Amin, testified that Samudra once asked him: "Are you ready to carry a martyr's bomb?"	
Junaedi, an accomplice in a robbery to help fund the bombings, said he did not reply.	
Police accused regional terror group Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), which is believed linked to al-Qaeda, of staging the bombing of nightspots crowded with Western holidaymakers to avenge perceived injustices against Muslims worldwide.	
Rauf is on trial for robbing a jewellery shop in Banten to fund the Bali bombings.	Bali PLACE country="ID" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17328623" id="Pl-12" latLong="8.333°S 115.000°E" state="BA" type="RGN",Banten PLACE country="ID" form="NAM" id="Pl-20" type="PPL"
Like Samudra, he has been described as a computer expert.	
One of Rauf's accomplices in the robbery, Andri Oktavia, said he was "doubtful" about the possibility of staging a suicide attack.	
"It was only Iqbal who expressed readiness," Oktavia told judges.	
Prosecutors say Iqbal detonated an explosives-stuffed vest he was wearing inside Paddy's Bar .	
Seconds later a man called Arnasan detonated a huge van bomb outside the nearby Sari Club .	
Arnasan died but it was unclear if he intended to be a suicide bomber.	
The disclosure that at least one suicide bomber was involved in the Bali attack heightened concern among security forces in Southeast Asia , where such tactics were previously unknown.

Both Rauf and Oktavia said they used three handguns lent to them by Samudra in the robbery.	
Samudra, who police say has admitted ordering the Bali attack, denied that he conspired with the witnesses to rob the jewellery shop.	Bali PLACE country="ID" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17328623" id="Pl-12" latLong="8.333°S 115.000°E" state="BA" type="RGN"
"They did not say that the guns were to be used in a robbery.	
As far as I knew they borrowed them for jihad," Samudra told the court.	
"If I had known they were to be used in a robbery I wouldn't have lent them," he said, adding that robberies were forbidden in Islam.	
Oktavia said at first he thought the robbery was justified.	
"I was thinking that maybe it was okay to rob Chinese.	
They are rich while most people in Banten are very poor.	Banten PLACE country="ID" form="NAM" id="Pl-20" type="PPL"
Besides... I was not going to use the money myself.	
It was for oppressed people," he said.	
"But after thinking it over, it was somewhat wrong," he said.	
Rauf and Oktavia said Samudra took them to Bali before the bombings but they did not know why.	Bali PLACE country="ID" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17328623" id="Pl-12" latLong="8.333°S 115.000°E" state="BA" type="RGN"
Rauf said Samudra allowed them to return and told him: "You can always wage jihad anywhere."	
Junaedi said Samudra once showed him Paddy's and the Sari Club . "He told me to take note, this is a place where white people gather, and take note of the streets here," Junaedi testified.	
The trial was adjourned until Thursday.	
Samudra and other key suspects face death if convicted.

In a statement, the acting High Commissioner for Human Rights Bertrand Ramcharan said he deeply regretted the executions.	
"These executions render futile (the) review by the Human Rights Committee of these cases, which amount to a grave breach of Uzbekistan 's obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights," the statement said.

The struggle by supporters of firebrand cleric Moqtada Sadr to push the religious hierarchy into a more antagonistic approach towards the Americans has seen three attacks on mainstream clerics in the past two weeks, sources say.	American PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-19" type="COUNTRY"
"Such crimes are aimed at provoking disturbances in the town , but the people have ignored them," said a son of Ayatollah Mohammad Said al-Hakim, one of Shiite Islam's top four clerics.	town PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897127" id="Pl-18" latLong="31.992°N 44.351°E" state="NA" type="PPL"

A theology student, Amjad al-Azari, was beaten with the butt of a rifle on Tuesday for refusing to drive armed men to Hakim junior's house , a source close to the Hawza said.	
Similarly, last Sunday, Sheikh Dia al-Modhaffar, a relative of Ayatollah Hakim, was beaten black and blue in the street by unknown assailants.	
Supporters of Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, another of Shiite Islam's leading clerics, have also been subject to attacks.	
An official from his office, Ibrahim Layez, was admitted to hospital with multiple stab wounds two weeks ago, although he is now said to be out of danger.	
These attacks have been accompanied by "death threats" against the ayatollahs, said Hakim junior.	
Officially, no complaints have been filed, but the ayatollah's son blames those who see their only hope of power and influence in "chaos".	
"It must be an outsider, because the population is known for its allegiance to the Hawza and respect for it is sacrosanct in the town ," he said.	town PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897127" id="Pl-18" latLong="31.992°N 44.351°E" state="NA" type="PPL"
Instead, he pointed the finger at "certain blemishes on the name of Islam" who collude with the media, in a clear reference to Sadr, whose sermons are regularly featured on television.	
But a spokesman for Sadr denied any role in the violence, dismissing the allegations as "prejudice".	
"Any attack against a member of the Hawza, be he a dignitary or a simple student, is unacceptable," said Sheikh Mustafa Yaqubi.	
Yaqubi defended Sadr's opposition to the Americans, although he acknowledged it had little support among the tribes who still dominate the countryside.	American PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-19" type="COUNTRY"

Placido Mico Abogo, 39, secretary general of the main opposition party, the Convergence for Social Democracy (CPDS), was serving two years and eight months after being sentenced in June 2002 for alleged complicity in a plot against the president.	
He was originally sentenced to 14 years and eight months but the term was later reduced.	
Thirty other prisoners, 18 political opponents and 12 military officers, also sentenced in June 2002, have also been pardoned.	
News of the pardons came on the eve of celebrations marking the 24th anniversary of Obiang Nguema's seizing of power in the former central African Spanish colony in a coup.	Spanish PLACE country="ES" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19596523" id="Pl-5" latLong="40.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY"
The pardon "is granted to the indicted persons on condition that they do not again commit the crimes or errors under amnesty for a period of 10 years," according to a decree read on official media.	
Placido Mico Abogo was found guilty with 67 other defendants, civilian and military, for taking part in a plot whose existence they denied.	
The two alleged ringleaders, Felipe Ondo Obiang, who held ministerial office several times and was speaker of the parliament, and former finance minister Guillermo Nguema Ela, will not benefit from the amnesty.	
They are leaders of the banned Republican Democratic Force (FDR) opposition party and are serving sentences of 20 and 14 years respectively.	
A further 30 people found guilty were pardoned in October last year on the occasion of the national holiday.	national PLACE country="GQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:17935106" id="Pl-6" latLong="2.000°N 10.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
Three others died in hospital from injuries allegedly received during their detention and questioning.	
The trial of more than 140 people began on May 23, 2002 after the defendants, who included opposition leaders, a score of military men and four women, had been rounded up by security forces in March.	
Seventy-six were acquitted.	
It was held in the disused Narsil cinema , where the country 's first president Francisco Macias Nguema was tried and sentenced to death after his overthrow by the current head of state, his nephew.	country PLACE country="GQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:17935106" id="Pl-9" latLong="2.000°N 10.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
Defence lawyers denounced the trial as being politically motivated and directly targetting opposition leaders, particularly the heads of the FDR.	
When the trial opened, Ondo Obiang limped into court and many of the accused had visible difficulty raising their right hand for the oath of truth.	
Five defendants who gave evidence at the start of the trial all said confessions had been extracted from them by torture.	
Former UN special rapporteur in Guinea , Gustavo Gallon, said in a report from the country that torture was used there as a "normal means of investigation".

Struggling Konica and Minolta merged Tuesday to form Konica Minolta Holdings Inc., Japan 's fourth-largest camera and office equipment maker, a company spokesman said.	Japan PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-4" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
Minolta shares, which were delisted in late July, will be exchanged for 0.	
621 Konica shares, which were to take the name of the holding company Tuesday, a company spokesman said.	
Minolta Co. Ltd. will be dissolved as a company by October 1.	
"We plan to release new digital cameras and other products with the new brand some time next year," said spokesman Katsuyuki Sakai.	
The merger of the camera and office equipment makers, announced in January, was made "in order to survive amidst today's global competition", the new company said in a release Tuesday.	
The company plans to cut 4,000 jobs from the combined workforce of 38,500 and reduce overlaps in plants and stores by March 2006, it said.	
Konica Corp., a camera and film maker, and Minolta Co. Ltd., a camera, copier and printer firm, have jointly developed and produced copiers since 2000.	
In the year to March 2006, the new company is targeting an operating profit of 150 billion yen (1.3 billion dollars) on sales of 1.3 trillion yen, making it the fourth-ranked photographic equipment maker in Japan behind leader Canon, Fuji Photo Film and Ricoh.

2004-11-01T18:06:00 I wish I could have been at a Pub , or wherever these people convene, to see the reactions from all the Britons who read the Telegraph this morning (emphasis added): Britain 's gun laws are aimed at the wrong target, curbing and criminalising legal ownership while failing to tackle huge rises in shooting offences over the past few years, according to an international firearms legislation expert.	 ,Britain PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-3" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY"

 Get Off Their Backs	
2004-11-16T13:47:00 From Reuters : U.S. Marines rallied round a comrade under investigation for killing a wounded Iraqi during the offensive in Falluja , saying he was probably under combat stress in unpredictable, hair-trigger circumstances.

Marines interviewed on Tuesday said they didn't see the shooting as a scandal, rather the act of a comrade who faced intense pressure during the effort to quell the insurgency in the city . "I can see why he would do it.	city PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897741" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.356°N 43.783°E" state="IQ-AN" type="PPL"

There should be an investigation but they should look into the circumstances," said Lance Corporal Christopher Hanson.	
"I would have shot the insurgent too.	
Two shots to the head," said Sergeant Nicholas Graham, 24, of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . "You can't trust these people.

He should not be investigated.

Of course the anti- American world press is jumping all over this story, casually omitting the fact that just a day earlier the marine in question lost a fellow soldier who was attending to a dead insurgent that was booby-trapped with explosives.

For that I believe the Marines should handle dead and wounded insurgents by any means necessary to ensure their own safety and prevent a possible ambush.	
I'm no fan of this war either, but it irks me to no end reading and listening to civilian opinions on how soldiers should conduct themselves in hostile war zones from their comfortable recliners.

 Not to be Ignored	
2004-12-01T23:13:00 More than a few e-mails have come in wondering why I haven't remarked on the horrible hunting tragedy on Nov. 21 that left six people dead, and why I haven't updated the ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN COUNTER.	
I didn't mean to wait this long and never intended to ignore the issue, but I have been extremely busy last week with Thanksgiving and everything that goes along with it.	
This is problem that needs to be addressed.	
But as for the assault weapons ban issue, the man accused of the brutal killings, Chai Vang of St. Paul , Minn , used a Russian -built Saiga 7.62 mm, SKS semiautomatic rifle.	Minn PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:663849" id="Pl-2" latLong="46.250°N 94.250°W" state="US-MN" type="CIVIL",Russian PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-4" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY",St. Paul PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:663851" id="Pl-1" latLong="44.944°N 93.093°W" state="US-MN" type="PPL"
As this article points out, the SKS wasn't included on the list of banned weapons as part of the 10-year ban on certain "assault weapons" signed by President Clinton.	
The ban expired in September and at the time of this posting, no one has been killed by any one of those weapons since the ban expired.	
But let's talk about this case, as I'm sure discussions have started and many want stronger gun control because of this freak incident.	
While the media use words like "military style," "assault" and "semiautomatic," the gun used in the slayings was not unlike a typical hunting rifle.	
The SKS is a medium-powered carbine equipped with a 10-round magazine, just like the pistol I'm displaying in the photo on the left hand side of this blog.	
Banned weapons had capacities of more than 10 rounds; so like my small 9mm, the SKS was not classified as an "assault" weapon.	
So let's not center our discussion around the gun, let's talk about the person behind the trigger.	
If convicted of the killings, Vang faces life in prison as Minnesota does not honor the death penalty.	Minn PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:663849" id="Pl-2" latLong="46.250°N 94.250°W" state="US-MN" type="CIVIL",Minnesota PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:663849" id="Pl-3" latLong="46.250°N 94.250°W" state="US-MN" type="CIVIL"
I look forward to Vang's conviction and I pray for the families of the victims.	
What happened was indefensible and justice must be served.	
 Life-Saving Disease	
2004-12-03T19:59:00 Here's an incredible story about an unsung hero until now.

The trick of prescribing Jews with a mysterious illness terrified the Nazis and saved 45 Roman Jews.	
Dr Vittorio Sacerdoti has told his remarkable tale on the 60th anniversary of liberation of Rome .	Rome PLACE country="IT" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19873307" id="Pl-2" latLong="41.900°N 12.483°E" state="IT-RM" type="PPLC"
Just 28 years old at the time, he used courage and ingenuity to save 45 people from certain death.	
As other Jews were being rounded up, Dr Sacerdoti admitted anyone who could reach the hospital as patients - and diagnosed them with a dangerous disease.	
"We would write on their medical forms that the patient was suffering from K Syndrome," he said.	
"We called it K after the German commander Kesserling - the Nazis thought it was cancer or tuberculosis, and they fled like rabbits."	German PLACE country="DE" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18224345" id="Pl-3" latLong="51.500°N 10.500°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
K Syndrome saved his cousin, Luciana Sacerdoti, who was just 10 years old.	
"The day the Nazis came to the hospital , someone came to our room and said: 'You have to cough, you have to cough a lot because they are afraid of the coughing, they don't want to catch an awful disease and they won't enter'."	
 It's Just Armor	
2004-12-08T21:33:00 Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld took part in a Q&amp;A with the troops today that was anything but cozy.	
Disgruntled soldiers complained to Rumsfeld about long deployments and a lack of armored vehicles and other equipment.	
From the Associated Press : "You go to war with the Army you have," Rumsfeld replied, "not the Army you might want or wish to have."	
Spc.	
Thomas Wilson had asked the defense secretary, "Why do we soldiers have to dig through local landfills for pieces of scrap metal and compromised ballistic glass to up-armor our vehicles?"	
Shouts of approval and applause arose from the estimated 2,300 soldiers who had assembled to see Rumsfeld.	
"We do not have proper armored vehicles to carry with us north," Wilson, 31, of Nashville , Tenn. , concluded after asking again.	Tenn.

Wilson, an airplane mechanic whose unit, the 278th Regimental Combat Team of the Tennessee Army National Guard, is about to drive north into Iraq for a one-year tour of duty, put his finger on a problem that has bedeviled the Pentagon for more than a year.	Tennessee PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1326873" id="Pl-3" latLong="35.750°N 86.250°W" predicative="true" state="US-TN" type="CIVIL",Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
Rarely, though, is it put so bluntly in a public forum.	
Rumsfeld said the Army was sparing no expense or effort to acquire as many Humvees and other vehicles with extra armor as it can. What is more, he said, armor is not the savior some think it is.	
"You can have all the armor in the world on a tank and a tank can (still) be blown up," he said.	
Can't say that's the most comforting answer.

2004-12-15T23:02:00 From the Associated Press : City residents will vote next year on a proposed weapons ban that would deny handguns to everyone except law enforcement officers, members of the military and security guards.

Quote of the day: "Firearms would be allowed only for police officers, security guards, members of the military, and anyone else actually employed and engaged in protecting and preserving property or life within the scope of his or her employment."	
So preserving property or life within the scope of self-defense and protection of the home is not allowed.	
No thanks.	
If the people vote for this measure it will be hard to sympathize with them when robbery and rape rates skyrocket, because burgulars will know homes are not guarded, and rapists will know the only thing stopping them from the victim they desire is their own inhibitions.

Her husband received a call from her saying she had gone into labor and given birth.	
The next day, authorities say, Montgomery confessed that she strangled Stinnett from behind, cut her open, removed the baby and cut her umbilical cord.	
I don't understand how we can call this fetus-thing that was ripped from a mother's womb a "child" or "girl" in a society that sanctions partial-birth abortion.	
If you can't charge someone for killing a fetus via abortion during the eighth month, then surely you can't make a big deal about a woman who kidnapped a fetus that survived the knifing.	
On a less-sarcastic note, I pray for the family of the 23-year-old woman.	
No one should have to die because some crazy nut wanted a child and decided to kill for it.	
If there's any good news in this story, it's that Victoria Jo will live on and carry her mother's memory.

Of course, I'm sure the Democrats would also like to start winning elections again.	
From the Los Angeles Times : After long defining itself as an undisputed defender of abortion rights, the Democratic Party is suddenly locked in an internal struggle over whether to redefine its position to appeal to a broader array of voters.

The fight is a central theme of the contest to head the Democratic National, particularly between two leading candidates: former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who supports abortion rights, and former Indiana Rep. Tim Roemer, an abortion foe who argues that the party cannot rebound from its losses in the November election unless it shows more tolerance on one of society's most emotional conflicts.

No Democrat with any respect for his unraveling party would ever mention Howard Dean's name again.	
The fact that he didn't win a single primary outside his home state shows that the country does not embrace his radical liberalism.	state PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:1780802" id="Pl-5" latLong="44.000°N 72.750°W" state="US-VT" type="CIVIL",country PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-6" type="COUNTRY"
Of course outspoken organizations such as Planned Parenthood, which gives a lot of money to Democrats, will fight with everything they've got to keep the Democratic platform as liberal as possible.	
Results from the last few elections suggest that wouldn't be such a good idea if they ever want to gain more power in Congress.

Back in November I linked to this fraud's malfunctioned SNL performance when a technical glitch caused the vocal track from her first song to repeat during the second, proving she lip-synchs, even though she has been quoted saying she doesn't.	
The humiliation and assault-on-music continued last night, when for some reason she decided to use her own voice in a wretched halftime performance at the Orange Bowl which ended in a shower of boos.	
You can see the video here if you can stand to watch a young no-talent wannabe continue to humiliate herself in public.

 Bush administration quietly stops destroying chemical and biological weapons	
Mon, 24 Jan 2005 05:40:37 -0600 Bush administration quietly stops destroying chemical and biological weapons Unnoticed by anyone else, the Bush administration has quietly ditched programs to destroy America 's biggest-in-the-world stockpile of chemical and biological weapons.

 Jack Welch seeks details on estranged wife's work in divorce case	
Retired General Electric Co. Chairman Jack Welch is seeking work-related documents of his estranged wife in his high-stakes divorce case.	
The Welches disclosed their plans to divorce a year ago, shortly after Suzy Wetlaufer _ then editor of the Harvard Business Review _ revealed she had become romantically involved with Welch while working on a story about him.	
In court papers filed this week in state Supreme Court in New York , Welch requested a deposition next month of David Heleniak, a senior partner in the law firm of Shearman &amp; Sterling in New York .

He also wants to subpoena all documents maintained in Jane Beasley Welch's personnel file by Shearman &amp; Sterling, a prestigious corporate law firm where she worked before she married Welch.	
Welch specifically is seeking performance evaluations, correspondence between his estranged wife and partners while she worked at the law firm's office in London , and documents related to her prospects of becoming a partner.	office PLACE country="GB" form="NOM" id="Pl-131" state="GB-ENG" type="FAC",London PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17398111" id="Pl-6" latLong="51.500°N 0.117°W" state="GB-ENG" type="PPLC"
Welch also wants details on Jane Beasley Welch's salary, benefits, retirement plan and other compensation paid to her.	
Michael York, one of Jack Welch's attorneys, called the move routine.	
A judge ruled in February that depositions in the divorce case will remain confidential.	
Earlier documents in the case have included embarrassing details about perks Welch received as part of his retirement package from GE at a time when corporate scandals were sparking outrage.	
The court order was requested by Jack Welch's attorney, Daniel K. Webb, who said Welch would likely be asked about his business dealings, his health and entries in his personal diary.	
Webb also said details of the breakdowns of the Welches' previous marriages were likely to come up, and cited reports of alleged extramarital affairs by both.	
Welch has previously failed in an attempt to temporarily seal a financial affidavit.	
That document detailed monthly outlays of some $51,000 for upkeep on a half-dozen houses scattered from Massachusetts to Florida , more than $52,000 for gifts and nearly $9,000 for food and drink, among other expenses.

The storm cut visibility to about 100 yards (91 meters).	
Hundreds of cases of water were stacked on three of the trucks.	
The rest carried boxes of tuna, crackers, sweets and other food.	
As the trucks lumbered past blasted buildings on the Iraq - Kuwait border, an Iraqi boy of about 10 pointed to his mouth and shouted ``Eat, eat!'' People lined up along the streets, giving thumbs-up signs to the aid convoy as it rolled by and begging for food and cigarettes.

 Grandson of Toyota founder promoted to senior managing director	
Toyota Motor Corp. said Tuesday it will promote Akio Toyoda, a grandson of the company's founder who is widely viewed as a candidate to some day head Japan 's largest automaker.	Japan PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-3" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" mod="CENTRAL" type="COUNTRY"
Managing director Toyoda, 46, grandson of Kiichiro Toyoda and the eldest son of Toyota honorary chairman Shoichiro Toyoda, will become one of 14 senior managing directors under a streamlined management system set to be introduced after a shareholders' meeting in June, the company said in a statement.	
Toyoda, who joined Toyota, based in Toyota city , central Japan , in 1984, spearheaded the automaker's Internet and telematics business _ a technology that puts wireless communications into vehicles.

Toyoda has been on the star track for years.	
When he joined the board in 2000, he was its youngest member.	
Under a reform led by President Fujio Cho, the membership of Toyota's board of directors will be slashed to 27 from 58.	
Executive vice presidents will be reduced to seven from nine.	
The new system is designed to ``speed up decision-making and operations,'' Toyota spokesman Shigeru Hayakawa said.	
Toyota's top posts held by Cho and Chairman Hiroshi Okuda remain unchanged.	
Kiichiro Toyoda founded the automaker in 1937, transforming the loom manufacturer started by his father into an automaker.

  BODY	
Spurned by U.S. over human rights, Indonesia turns to Russia for arms HEADLINE JAKARTA , Indonesia (AP) The dictator Suharto has fallen, the constitution has changed, the media was unshackled, democratic elections held, and East Timor freed.	 
After Sept. 11, 2001, Indonesia was quick to sign onto U.S. President George W. Bush's global war on terror.	 
Yet, Washington maintains a 12-year ban on arms sales to the world's most populous Muslim nation with the aim of curbing human rights abuses still happening despite momentous political change.	 
Frustrated, Jakarta's generals are looking elsewhere to replace antiquated arsenals.	 
Later this month Indonesian President Megawati Sukarnoputri travels to Moscow to seek the Kremlin 's help in modernizing her increasingly obsolete 300,000-member armed forces.	 
She is also likely to open the way for Russian companies to vie for lucrative deals in the oil and gas sector, long dominated by American and British resource giants.	 
Although opposite ends of the Earth, Indonesia and Russia have some basic things in common.	 
Both are geographically sprawling with massive multiethnic populations.	 
Both are struggling to preserve national unity as they fight separatism and build democracy after the collapse of decades of authoritarian rule.	 
Both are resource-rich, but face huge economic problems made worse by endemic corruption.	 
And, currently, both have opposed the U.S. - led war on Iraq .	 
Indonesia's Foreign Ministry spokesman Marty Natalegawa says Megawati's meeting with Russian President Putin slated for April 21 will touch on the Iraq crisis.	 
But other diplomats say that issue will serve primarily to bring the two closer together on bottom-line issues such as trade and arms sales.	 
Analysts worry that Indonesia's military is now so degraded it can no longer control the borders of the far-flung archipelago, allowing for easy infiltration by extremists.	 
Last year's Bali bombings, which killed 202 people, illustrated the threat of terrorism in Indonesia .	 
And, broad opposition to the U.S. -led attack on Iraq threatens to lead to a backlash by militant Islamists.	 
``Nearly everybody in Indonesia sees this Iraq war as completely unnecessary and there is widespread public opposition to U.S. policies,'' said Jusuf Wanadi of the Center for Strategic and International Studies SIGNAL id="S-1" in SIGNAL Jakarta .	 
Close ties between Moscow and Jakarta are not unprecedented.	 
Indonesia relied on Soviet military assistance in the 1950s under Megawati's father and founding President Sukarno, but these were severed after the anti-communist Gen. Suharto seized power in 1965.	 
The United States quickly became the Southeast Asian country 's main weapons supplier, and annual arms sales peaked at US$400 million in the 1980s.	 
In 1991, however, the U.S. Congress banned this after Indonesian troops killed hundreds of civilians in East Timor .	 
In 1999, East Timor became free, but only after Indonesian forces laid waste to it as they withdrew after a pro-independence referendum.	 
The shocking level of destruction prompted U.S. lawmakers to expand the ban to cover almost all military ties with Indonesia .	 
Since then some in the Bush administration _ particularly Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, a former ambassador to Jakarta and a prime architect of the Iraq war _ have pushed for the ban to be repealed.	 
So far, U.S. lawmakers have reinstated only a limited officer training program.	 
But that's far from enough for Indonesia's generals.	 
``I think the Indonesian military has finally decided that restrictions and conditionalities from Washington are just not worth it,'' said Juwono Sudarsono, a former defense minister.	 
``So they want to look for alternative sources for planes, helicopters and other hardware.'' Moscow has already had some success in wooing Indonesia as a customer.	 
Jakarta has recently purchased some Russian weapons, including 10,000 Kalashnikov assault rifles, a squadron of naval Mil-2 helicopters and a dozen BTR-80A amphibious carriers for its marines.	 
Currently, Indonesia uses short-range Rapier missiles purchased 30 years ago to protect its vital oil and natural gas fields in Sumatra , Borneo and Papua from air attack.	 
``Replenishing them has been a big problem,'' Sudarsono said.	 
Air defense commanders want to augment the Rapiers with Russia's impressive long-range S-300 missiles, or shorter-range systems such as the SA-15 Gauntlet or shoulder-fired Igla.	 
The Air Force is reportedly considering purchasing several squadrons of Sukhoi Su-27 interceptors, considered the world's premier dogfighters.	 
Previously, Indonesian Air Force commanders preferred Western jets that were compatible with the U.S. -made F-16 fighter-bombers already in the Indonesian inventory.	 
But neighboring Malaysia 's success in integrating Russian MiG-29s and American F A-18 Hornets persuaded them otherwise, Sudarsono said.	 
If Megawati does stiff-arm the United States on the weapons issue, it is unlikely relations with Washington will be permanently damaged.	 
Whatever happens, Indonesia , a mainly Muslim but politically secular state, is natural ally in the struggle against terrorism and religious militancy.	 
What could be more worrying for Washington is Russia's economic ambitions.	 
Trade between Indonesia and Russia increased by dlrs 36.2 million to dlrs 203.5 million in 2001 _ the last year for which statistics are available.	 
Analysts say this can only grow.	 
The real concerns, though, are in the petroleum sector.	 
Megawati and Putin are expected to sign agreements to give Russian companies a toehold in Indonesia's oil and gas industry, long dominated by American and British giants such as Exxon Mobil and BP.

``One has to go through the process of building from the bottom up, allowing the leadership to establish itself, and then the election process to go through and so forth,'' Cross said.	
``That full electoral process may well take longer.'' Garner's Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance is charged with coordinating humanitarian assistance, rebuilding infrastructure shattered by years of war and U.N. sanctions, and gradually handing back power to Iraqis leading a democratically elected government.

Grigory Pasko's lawyer Genri Reznik filed the appeal with Russian Supreme Court, the Interfax and ITAR-Tass news agencies reported.	Russian PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-4" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
He asked the court to invalidate the verdict and throw out the criminal case against Pasko, they said.	
Pasko was sentenced to four years in prison in December 2001 for illegally attending a meeting of top military commanders and taking notes there.	
A military court said he intended to pass the notes to Japanese media with which he had worked.	Japanese PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-6" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
Pasko, whose sentence included time served, was released in January for good behavior after serving more than two-thirds of the sentence.	
He has maintained his innocence, saying the military was punishing him for exposing environmental abuses by the Russian navy, including the dumping of radioactive waste into the sea.

Reznik said an initial appeal he lodged the day Pasko was freed never reached the presidium of the Supreme Court, according to Interfax.	
The lawyer said the court's military board had refused to launch proceedings on the appeal.	
Reznik said he addressed the new appeal directly to Supreme Court Chairman Vyacheslav Lebedev and asked that it not be considered by military judges ``because the military justice system has adopted a biased attitude against Pasko,'' Interfax reported.

The fighting broke out between club-wielding members of the former ruler's clan and a rival group, he said.	
Clan rivalries aside, there are numerous other resentments shaping events in the post-Saddam era.

  Malaysian  court rejects Anwar's appeal against sodomy conviction	Malaysian PLACE country="MY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17594843" id="Pl-6" latLong="2.500°N 112.500°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
Malaysia 's second highest court on Friday rejected an appeal by jailed former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim against his conviction and nine-year prison sentence for sodomy.	Malaysia PLACE country="MY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17594843" id="Pl-4" latLong="2.500°N 112.500°E" type="COUNTRY",court PLACE country="MY" form="NOM" id="Pl-17" type="FAC"
A three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals unanimously upheld a verdict by High Court Judge Arifin Jaka nearly three years ago that found Anwar guilty of sodomizing his wife's former driver.	
Sodomy is a crime in this predominantly Muslim Southeast Asian country . Anwar is expected to appeal again with the Federal Court, Malaysia 's highest court.

Speaking to reporters after the verdict, Anwar lambasted the judges, saying they had been ``preselected'' by the government to quash his appeal.	
``These are spineless judges,'' Anwar said.	
``This decision is all scripted.'' The judges also rejected an application by Anwar to be released on bail.	
But Anwar's lawyers said they were filing a fresh request for bail pending a further appeal.	
On Monday, Anwar completed his sentence for a separate conviction on corruption charges, after the six-year sentence was reduced by one-third for good behavior.	
He then began serving the nine-year prison sentence for sodomy, his lawyers said.	
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar, his former protege, in 1998 following disputes over financial policy.	
Anwar led large protests against Mahathir before he was arrested, charged and convicted on corruption and sodomy charges.	
Anwar claims the charges were fabricated to keep him from challenging Mahathir for power.	
The government denies this.	
Human rights group Amnesty International said Friday's verdict ``represents another step in the further deterioration in the human rights situation in the country .'' ``This decision adds to the already widespread perception that in politically sensitive cases, the independence of the judiciary can no longer be guaranteed,'' the London -based group said in a statement.

``Today, the situation looks much bleaker.'' Param Cumaraswamy, the U.N. special investigator on the freedom of judges and lawyers, said in a statement: ``So long as there are judges who are prepared to and continue to compromise the value and principles of their high office ... there is no hope for judicial independence and impartiality in the Malaysian justice system.'' About 200 demonstrators outside the court shouted Anwar's slogan of ``Reformasi!'' for political change.

Police armed with automatic weapons stood by to prevent rowdiness.	
The court also dismissed a joint appeal by Anwar's adopted brother, Sukma Darmawan, who was convicted together with Anwar for sodomy in August 2000 and sentenced to six years in jail and whipping.	court PLACE country="MY" form="NOM" id="Pl-17" type="FAC"

The due date was April 27, the same day as Game 4 of the best-of-seven series between the Timberwolves and the Lakers.	
Teammate Kobe Bryant said he would not be surprised if O'Neal had a big game Sunday despite his expected late arrival in Minneapolis . ``You just roll off the adrenaline,'' said Bryant, who scored 48 points in a 2001 playoff game at Sacramento after leaving the team to attend to a personal matter.

UNITED NATIONS (AP) France on Tuesday proposed immediately suspending U.N. sanctions targeting Iraq civilians, an important step toward the U.S. goal of ending trade embargoes that have crippled the country 's economy.	Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-53" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY",country PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-37" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY",France PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18572019" id="Pl-35" latLong="46.000°N 2.000°E" type="COUNTRY",U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-9" type="COUNTRY"
The surprise move by France , which led opposition to the U.S. war against Iraq , followed last week's call by U.S. President George W. Bush for sanctions to be lifted quickly, so Iraq can trade freely and its oil revenue can be used to finance reconstruction.	Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-53" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY",France PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18572019" id="Pl-35" latLong="46.000°N 2.000°E" type="COUNTRY",U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-9" type="COUNTRY"
France 's U.N. ambassador, Jean-Marc de La Sabliere, made the proposal at a Security Council meeting where members heard a briefing by chief U.N. weapons inspector Hans Blix and for the first time exchanged views on potentially divisive postwar issues.	France PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18572019" id="Pl-35" latLong="46.000°N 2.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
The proposal would end the U.N. ban on trade and investment in Iraq while leaving a 12-year-old arms embargo in place.	Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-53" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY"

Along with France , Russia , Germany and China also strongly opposed the war.

But de La Sabliere said before the meeting that Security Council ``must take into account the new realities on the ground.'' Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov had said his country is ``not at all opposed to the lifting of sanctions.'' But he said Russia wants U.N. inspectors to certify that Iraq has been disarmed of all weapons of mass destruction, as required under U.N. resolutions.

Asked about the French proposal, he said: ``We are ready to discuss it.'' At another closed-door council meeting later Tuesday, the council was to hear from Benon Sevan, head of the U.N. oil-for-food program, which had been providing food for 60 percent of Iraq 's 24 million people.

France 's de La Sabliere said he also proposed that the council phase out the oil-for-food program, which allowed Iraq to sell unlimited quantities of oil provided the money went for humanitarian goods and compensation to victims of the first Gulf War.

``There should be some adjustment with a view of a phasing out of this program,'' de La Sabliere said.

He said important scientists had turned themselves in, and the atmosphere had changed which should enable any Iraqi ``to speak more freely and speak without fear of retribution to those who are asking them the questions.'' France 's de La Sabliere said he also proposed that the council ``find practical and pragmatic arrangements'' to coordinate and combine the work of the American teams and the work of U.N. inspectors ``so that the Iraqi disarmament could be internationally verified.'' He told The Associated Press he envisioned sanctions being suspended ``for a couple of months,'' and possibly renewed.

 Rudolph Giuliani, Judith Nathan to marry May 24 at Gracie Mansion	
Rudolph Giuliani will wed his companion, Judith Nathan, on May 24 in the ex-mayor's old home , Gracie Mansion .	 
The news was announced Thursday by Giuliani spokeswoman Sunny Mindel.	 
His successor, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, will perform the ceremony.	 
Giuliani, 58, proposed to Nathan, a former nurse, during a November business trip to Paris _ five months after he finalized his divorce from Donna Hanover after 20 years of marriage.	 ,Paris PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18543072" id="Pl-3" latLong="48.867°N 2.333°E" state="FR-75" type="PPLC"
In interviews last year, Giuliani said Nathan gave him ``tremendous emotional support'' through his treatment for prostate cancer and as he led the city during the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center . ``We were close already,'' Giuliani said.	 ,city PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-4" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="US-NY" type="PPL"
``And then we went through hell together.'' Giuliani and Nathan began appearing in public together in May 2000.	 
Soon after, he announced that he and Hanover were moving toward legal separation.	 
During the legal proceedings leading up to the divorce, a judge ruled that Nathan could not visit Gracie Mansion , the official mayoral residence , as long as Giuliani's children lived there.	 
Giuliani and Hanover have two teenage children, Andrew and Caroline.	 
The divorce settlement called for Giuliani to pay Hanover more than $6.8 million.	 
Hanover, 53, is host of a syndicated television show, ``Famous Homes and Hideaways.'' Last month, she and her fiance _ an old high school sweetheart _ invited the press along as they went shopping for wedding bands, saying they are planning a wedding in the New York City area this summer.	 ,New York City PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-2" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="US-NY" type="RGN"
Giuliani's first marriage to his second cousin, Regina Peruggi, lasted about 14 years.	 
It was annulled by the Catholic Church because the couple had not obtained a church dispensation required when second cousins marry.	 
Nathan divorced wallpaper salesman Bruce Nathan in 1992.	 
They have a teenage daughter.	 
The Giuliani-Nathan nuptials will be a first for Bloomberg, who is making an exception from his policy of not performing weddings, said Bloomberg spokesman Ed Skyler.	 
Giuliani regularly officiated at weddings while in office.	 
``The mayor is honored by their request,'' Skyler said.

An accident on a diesel-powered Chinese submarine has killed all 70 officers and sailors aboard, the official Xinhua News Agency reported Friday.	Chinese PLACE country="CN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18099327" id="Pl-13" latLong="35.000°N 105.000°E" type="COUNTRY"

The submarine was on an exercise when the accident occurred, and ``because of a mechanical malfunction, the 70 crew members on board died,'' the Xinhua report said.	
It did not give further details or say how the crew died.	
The vessel already has been towed back to an unidentified port, Xinhua said.	
It said the hull number was 361, which military analysts said appeared to make it a Ming-class submarine, a vessel used for patrols and coastal defense.	
The announcement was unusual for a communist government that rarely acknowledges military accidents.	
It was the first time China has announced a fatal submarine mishap, said Bernard Cole, a professor at the U.N. National War College in Washington and a specialist on the Chinese navy.

``There have been rumors going around about the loss of submarines, but this is the first fatal accident that I know of,'' said Cole.	
China 's military, which has a tradition of secrecy, did not comment about the accident Friday night.	China PLACE country="CN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18099327" id="Pl-10" latLong="35.000°N 105.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
Foreign military analysts said it would be highly unusual for an accident to kill a whole submarine crew while still allowing the vessel to be recovered.	
They suggested possible causes ranging from a sinking in shallow water to a disaster that flooded the vessel with toxic chemical fumes.	
Michael McGinty, an expert on the Chinese navy from the Royal United Services Institute for Defense Studies in London , said that the mishap likely happened while the submarine was on the surface.	Chinese PLACE country="CN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18099327" id="Pl-13" latLong="35.000°N 105.000°E" type="COUNTRY",London PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17398111" id="Pl-27" latLong="51.500°N 0.117°W" state="ENG" type="PPLC"
If the accident happened when the vessel was underwater, it was less likely that China could have recovered it, said McGinty, a former British submariner.	British PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-28" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY",China PLACE country="CN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18099327" id="Pl-10" latLong="35.000°N 105.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
``For an accident to have been so catastrophic when the submarine was on the surface, I find it a very mysterious thing,'' he said.	
McGinty said that the submarine's batteries might have leaked acid that mixed with seawater, creating toxic chlorine gas that killed the crew.	
The torpedoes might have leaked propellant that poisoned the crew, he said.	
The accident could have occurred as long ago as March, said Cole, a former U.S. Navy antisubmarine warfare officer.	U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" type="COUNTRY"
``There have been exercises going on in the Yellow Sea over the past two months,'' he said.	
``This boat could have been involved in those exercises and gone down over a month ago.'' Cole said the loss of all hands suggested the vessel was flooded or sank because of a collision or engineering problem.	
He said Ming-class subs usually carry a crew of 50, suggesting that the others aboard might have been technicians or staff officers.	
China began building the Ming-class subs in the 1970s, and they are obsolete by modern standards, according to the Federation of American Scientists.

The first three Ming-class subs were completed between 1971 and 1979, and one of them was scrapped after a fire, according to the Web site of Jane's Information Group, a leading of source defense information.	
China is believed to have as many as 19 Ming-class submarines.	China PLACE country="CN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18099327" id="Pl-10" latLong="35.000°N 105.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
China 's submarine fleet includes 66 boats, most of them aging diesel-electric vessels, McGinty said.	China PLACE country="CN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18099327" id="Pl-10" latLong="35.000°N 105.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
He said the fleet suffers from a chronic lack of money, training and maintenance.	
But the Chinese are aggressively updating their fleet with Russian -made Kilo-class diesel-electric subs.

``The submarine force is the most potent part of the Chinese navy,'' said Cole.	Chinese PLACE country="CN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18099327" id="Pl-13" latLong="35.000°N 105.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
Despite the difficulty of maintaining a fleet, subs are valuable because they are hard to detect, Cole said.	
In a conflict over Taiwan or some other confrontation, he said, `` China 's ability to field a force of even a dozen submarines could pose a big problem for any other naval force.'' Xinhua said former President Jiang Zemin, who is chairman of the commission that runs China 's military, on Friday sent condolences to family members of the crew.

I don't think the U.N. would want to take on that,'' Annan said.	
``There has been a suggestion that the U.N. wanted to take over the whole Iraq and run it, which was also not the case.'' What the United Nations could contribute beyond humanitarian assistance was ``political facilitation,'' Annan said.

 Court suspends independent paper for publishing letters deemed	
KHARTOUM , Sudan (AP) A state security court suspended a newspaper critical of the government Saturday after convicting it of publishing religiously inflammatory material, the newspaper's lawyer said.

The Khartoum Monitor may not appear for two months and must pay a fine of 1 million Sudanese pounds (about US $400), lawyer Ngor Olang Ngor told The Associated Press.	US PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-10" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY",Khartoum PLACE country="SD" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19998013" id="Pl-2" latLong="15.588°N 32.534°E" predicative="true" state="SD-KRT" type="PPLC",Sudan PLACE country="SD" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19985421" id="Pl-7" latLong="15.000°N 30.000°E" type="COUNTRY",Sudanese PLACE country="SD" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19985421" id="Pl-6" latLong="15.000°N 30.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
Failure to pay the fine would result in a two-month extension of the suspension.	
The sentence was the latest in a series of state actions against the Monitor, the only English language daily in Sudan and a leading critic of conditions in the south of the country , where a civil war has been waged for 20 years.

Ngor said the paper would pay the fine but it would also appeal the verdict.	
The court ruling stated that the verdict and sentence would be submitted to the National Press Council, a government-appointed body, for approval, Ngor said.	
The secretary general of the National Press Council, Hashim el-Jazz, did not answer repeated calls to his cell phone on Saturday.	
The court convicted the paper of violating article 25 of the Press Law, which prohibits the publication of material that defames religion or incites religiously unacceptable activity.	
The charges arose from letters-to-the-editor published last month that dealt with religion.	
One letter claimed that alcohol was not prohibited by Islam.	
Earlier this week, security police detained the Monitor's managing editor, Nhial Bol, for 24 hours.	
On his release, he was charged with incitement of public discord for publishing the letters.

The state's appeal was based on the judge refusing to recuse himself during Basson's 2 1 2-year trial.	
The prosecution alleged presiding Judge Willie Hartzenberg favored Basson.	
The appeal judges found Hartzenberg's refusal did not relate to an error of law on his part.	
Basson headed a program named Project Coast in the 1980's.	
During the trial witnesses testified that the project involved trying to create deadly bacteria and anti-fertility drugs that would only affect blacks.	
They poisoned opponents' clothing and stockpiled cholera, HIV and anthrax.	
The alleged intended victims included former President Nelson Mandela and several African National Congress leaders who are now high-ranking government officials.	
He had also been accused of siphoning millions of dollars from Project Coast to finance a lavish, globe-trotting lifestyle and of selling drugs. (sapa-es-dk)

  Mars  rover is launched on voyage to look for evidence of water	 
A rocket holding the first of two Mars rovers blasted off Tuesday on a seven-month voyage to the red planet where the golf-cart-sized vehicles will search for evidence that there was once enough water to support life on Mars .	 
The rover named Spirit lifted off from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station aboard a Boeing Delta II rocket at 1:58 p.m. (1758 GMT).	 ,Air Force Station PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-234" state="US-FL" type="FAC",Cape Canaveral PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:280995" id="Pl-12" latLong="28.406°N 80.605°W" predicative="true" state="US-FL" type="PPL"
Thunderstorms delayed the launch by two days, and launch officials contended with a last-minute communications glitch between stations that will track the spacecraft.	 
The second rover, named Opportunity, will be launched later this month, and both are expected to arrive at Mars in January.	 
Moving on six wheels, the $800 million rovers act as robotic geologists.	 
Each is equipped with a panoramic camera, a camera for close-up views of rocks and a drill to cut into rocks.	 
The data will be transmitted back to Earth .	 
Previous missions have shown Mars had water in the past, but scientists want to find out how long the water was there and in what quantities.	 
Scientists believe the water may show that Mars once was able to support life.	 
The rovers' landing sites, on opposite sides of the planet, were chosen for their likelihood of holding evidence of water.	 
Studying the minerals in rocks can tell scientists how the rocks were formed, whether they were ever submerged in water, and whether hot water ever ran over them.	 
The rovers are expected to travel up to 132 feet (39.6 meters) each Martian day, which is 24 hours and 39{ minutes long.	 
The missions are expected to last three months but could run longer.	 
The rovers eventually will shut down as dust builds up on their solar panels and they will remain on the planet.	 
Only 12 out of 30 previous attempts have reached Mars , and only three out of nine attempts have succeeded in landing on the planet.	 
NASA revamped its Mars program after the failure of two unmanned missions to Mars four years ago.	 
The space agency has been under intense scrutiny since February when the space shuttle Columbia disintegrated over Texas , killing all seven crew members.	 ,Texas PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780801" id="Pl-17" latLong="31.250°N 99.250°W" state="US-TX" type="CIVIL"

Retired navy officer regrets involvement in bungled plot to protect Ocalan HEADLINE ATHENS , Greece (AP) A retired navy officer facing life in prison over a failed effort to protect Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, told a court Thursday he felt remorse for his part in the 1999 plot.	 
``I have a guilty conscience,'' Andonis Naxakis said during his two-hour testimony.	 
Naxakis is one of 13 people on trial for bringing the fugitive guerrilla leader to Greece .	 
Ocalan was moved by the government to its embassy compound SIGNAL id="S-1" in SIGNAL Kenya , where he was captured by Turkish commandos.	 
The retired Greek officer said he had been trying to get Ocalan to The Netherlands , home to a large Kurdish community.	 
He claimed he had been manipulated by the government.	 
``I believe I was unwittingly used as bait for its disgraceful plan ... an organized move by the government to hand Ocalan over to Turkey ,'' he said.	 
Naxakis and two of Ocalan's Kurdish associates are being tried on criminal charges of endangering national security.	 
Ocalan, being tried in absentia, was indicted for entering the country illegally, a misdemeanor.	 
Ocalan, leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, is serving a life sentence in Turkey for leading a 15-year insurgency against the country that left 37,000 people dead.	 
He is being tried in Greece in absentia.

Club-wielding rioters smashed windows, burned parked cars, chased and beat reporters and blocked traffic here Thursday, vowing to remain until courts allowed former dictator Gen. Efrain Rios Montt to register as a candidate for the Nov. 9 presidential election.	
Police did little to prevent the violence, but protesters quickly left Friday after Rios Montt asked them to halt demonstrations.	
A constitutional prohibition on former coup leaders kept Rios Montt out of two previous presidential runs.	
But this year, the country 's highest tribunal, the Court of Constitutionality, approved his candidacy.	country PLACE country="GT" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:18864178" id="Pl-7" latLong="15.500°N 90.250°W" type="COUNTRY"

But Morales said he feared Rios Montt's political sympathizers could return to the streets with even greater violence.	
A spokesman for the Collective Organization of Civil Societies said the group is asking an election tribunal to suspend Rios Montt's Guatemalan Republican Front party, which controls the presidency and enjoys a majority in Congress.

The same might be said of Chap's condiment-packaged business bill.

If not bordering on the political ridorkulous (ridiculously dorky), it's just plain ludicrous to believe business owners would agree to a capital investment with strings attached to the businesses health and longevity.

In the latest edition, staff writer Jeremy M. Lazarus reports that the Legislative Black Caucus celebrated killing a bill that would have merged the Department of Minority Business Enterprise (DMBE) with the Department of Business Assistance (DBA).	
Del.	
Dwight Jones (D- Richmond ), chair of the caucus, said killing the bill had been their "main objective" in an effort to, according to Lazarus, "promote economic justice for black businesses."

I believe any neutral management consultant worth his or her salt would recommend a merger of the two organizations.	
There is considerable duplication of effort and DBA is strong in one area--financial controls--where DMBE has consistently had problems.	
There would be service benefits to business clients, too.	
Nonetheless, the symbolism of having their "own" agency and support from Governor Warner for maintaining DMBE's "independence" apparently overcame any efficiency and service argument.

Robinson worked with Thurgood Marshall on Brown v. Board of Education .	
Faulk finds the nomination a "surprise" in light of Allen's past, when he "embraced and glorified the Confederate flag and its sympathizers."	
Faulk chalks the naming up to Allen's presidential ambitions.	
It's tough to be a Republican when it comes to the African - American community.

Among some segments of the African-American community, it is indeed a matter of damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't.	
But you could say the same thing of the Democratic Party as a whole.	
I think it's important to recognize that African Americans, though still overwhelmingly Democratic, comprise less of a monolith than they did 20-30 years ago.	
I find myself continually amazed at how open-minded many young African-Americans are.	
And I think that open-mindedness goes a long way to explain the desperate efforts of many (not all, but many) within the Democratic Party to circle the wagons with the cry of "racism, racism, racism" when the evidence of racism is increasingly a stretch.	
It's like how, after the Civil War, Republicans "waved the bloody shirt", associating the Democratic Party with the secession and, ultimately, the war itself.	
Eventually, that tactic lost its power.	
And so, too, will the cries of racism, racism.

No opposing view. ... This is not just liberal, but dumb liberal--NPR could easily have found a Democrat, maybe even an old Democrat, who believed CDBGs are an ineffective antipoverty program.	
(Basically they are slush funds for local politicians, who too often sluice the federal money to their developer friends to build ugly downtown hotels.

 Kaine on Death and Taxes	
2005-02-14T09:44:00 by Steven Sisson Choir boy Tim Kaine is a political moderate informed by his Catholic beliefs.	
But look for the Kilgore team to paint him as a liberal for his record on tax hikes and the death penalty.	
The Blue Dog personally views Lt. Gov. Tim Kaine as a moderate-to-conservative politician.	
Kaine has never been an Amway Christian, nor does he hold a lifetime membership to the C-E Club (i.e., only attending church service on Christmas and Easter holidays).

Who is this guy trying to kid?	
Kaine is as liberal as they come.	
Who other than a left-wing liberal would agree to represent a two-time murderer (Lem Tugle) for free, to try and keep him from getting the death penalty.	
Tugle was on trial for raping and killing a southwest Virginia grandmother.	
After killing her, he dumped her body down the same ditch where he dumped the 17-year-old girl he had previously been convicted of murdering.	
Tugle was on parole for this crime when he killed the grandmother.	
I understand that representing people is what attorneys do but even attorneys have some choice in whom they represent.	
The line of defense Kaine used was that Tugle had not really raped the grandmother because "forcable sodomy was not rape according to the law at the time."	
 Car Tax Cut Acceleration Hits a Wall	
2005-02-16T15:36:00 As expected the Senate Finance Committee this afternoon killed a proposal by House Republicans to finish implementation of the car tax cut by phasing out the remaining 30% over the next six years.	
The move leaves intact state reimbursement for the locally-imposed property tax at an aggregate of $950 million annually.	
At present, that amount covers approximately 70% of the tax for the average affected car owner.	
The commitee action comes two days before House and Senate budget conferees are expected to begin negotiating differences in the respective proposals.

T09:01:00 Hand in hand with any consideration of the redistricting process, we shoul give some thought to the structural relationship between the state House and Senate.	
Currently, each House member represents approximately 75,000 Virginians, while each Senator represents appoximately 187,500.	Virginia PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780803" id="Pl-2" latLong="37.500°N 78.500°W" state="US-VA" type="CIVIL"
Often as not, there is no rational commonality between the two.	
Some senators represent people pools that are in turn fractured into five or six House districts.	
I believe this accounts, in large part, for the dysfunction that characterizes our state government now.	
Former Governor Gerald Baliles, in this same vein, has advocated a realignment of the two houses in a way that serves commonalities.	
He has suggested that we either increase membership in the Senate to 50, or decrease House membership to 80, producing a scenario wherein 1 Senator would represent a block of people who are represented by exactly 2 Delegates.	
He thinks--and I think he is right--that this arrangement would foster a closer working relationship between the Senate and the House.	
You certainly wouldn't have these dysfunctional groupings we now have, where 1 Senator often represents a population divided among half a dozen Delegates of two parties--three, if you count independents.

 Two Reactions, Two Worlds	
2005-02-22T08:17:00 Del.	
Adam Ebbin (D, Alexandria ) is the first openly gay member to serve in the House of Delegates.	Alexandria PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1493456" id="Pl-1" latLong="38.805°N 77.047°W" state="US-VA" type="PPL"
There's a brief profile of Ebbin by Kristen Gelineau in today's Daily Press . What I found interesting was the contrast in reactions to Ebbin from two colleagues: "I suppose that one of the concerns was that since he is the only openly gay member of the Legislature, is whether or not that would be the only issue that he would ... talk about," said Del.	
Ward Armstrong, D- Henry County . "That clearly has not been the case.	Henry County PLACE country="US" county="Henry County" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1503770" id="Pl-2" latLong="36.667°N 79.883°W" state="US-VA" type="CIVIL"
He is a very versatile delegate." Del.	
Richard Black, R- Loudoun , who has compiled a track record as one of the most socially conservative members of the state legislature and was the sponsor of the gay adoption bill, said he's not trying to stamp out gay rights but is simply trying to preserve tradition.	Loudoun PLACE country="US" county="Loudoun" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1501160" id="Pl-4" latLong="39.006°N 77.429°W" predicative="true" state="US-VA" type="PPL"
As for his personal feelings on Ebbin, after a lengthy pause, the Loudoun Republican offered: "He's always prompt and, you know, on time to meetings."

A moment later, he added, "I think he works hard."	
I think it's possible to support some of Black's positions but still be very disappointed by his cold assessment of a colleague.

He gets rewarded by having to pay an immigration attorney thousands of dollars while getting yanked around by the Immigration Service... not to mention, he's paying the government thousands in taxes.	
He gets very frustrated because many of his contemporaries work for cash under the table.	
They aren't paying lawyers, and they pay nothing into the system.	
Of course, the Americans who employ illegal immigrants are happy to pay in cash because it means cheaper labor for them.	
Who benefits?	
The illegal immigrants themselves, of course.	
The employers who hire them instead of raising wages to attract native-born Americans and legal immigrants.	
And families who hire cheap domestic labor, whether to clean the house, wash the laundry or maintain the lawn.	
Who loses?	
Poor, native-born Americans who otherwise would be paid higher wages for their manual labor.	
Legal immigrants like my Brazilian friend, who sometimes feels like a sap for playing by the rules.	Brazilian PLACE country="BR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19368722" id="Pl-4" latLong="10.000°S 55.000°W" type="COUNTRY"
And the rest of us who won't hire anyone to work for us unless they're paying their taxes, even if it means we pay more.	
Yeah, I've got a problem with turning around and giving illegal immigrants all the rights and privileges of the native born and the legal immigrants who've played by the rules.	
Yes, I do.	
 Where is Investigative Journalism?	
2005-02-27T12:38:00 Governor Mark Warner has turned state government upside-down in an effort to do more business with small, women, and minority owned (SWAM) firms and the thanks he gets are headlines like this one in the Daily Press : Warner's plan to raise contracting diversity falls short .	
The article is full of innuendo that procurement officals are ignoring the Governor's wishes and just waiting for him to leave office, that "special deals" are cut with non-SWAM vendors, and that somehow the electronic procurement system is "stacked" against SWAM firms.	
If true, these are serious charges, worthy of high-level investigation.	
What's missing from the article, though, is any attempt at investigative journalism to give even one factual example supporting the innuendo.	
What's also missing is a fair-minded review of whether the sagging numbers reported for SWAM procurement are valid.	
Someday a journalist is going to take the time to watch a sample number of SWAM firms submit bids on openly posted contracts, then use procurement tools that are in place to determine if any SWAM firms were unfairly denied contracts they deserved.	
Until then, this carping appears to be sour grapes.	
Governor Warner has done plenty to open up the system to SWAM firms and give them a presumptive advantage, even inviting a backlash by non-SWAM firms.	
Maybe SWAM firms aren't doing all they can to return the Governor's faith in them.

 A REAL RACE FOR GOVERNOR	
2005-03-02T12:26:00 If there are three in the race for governor it takes 33.4% to win.	
If there are four does it take 25.1% to win?	
If so, what about this scenario?	
George Fitch does not smoke out Kilgore and Kilgore gets the Republican nomination in spite of his tax and spend hidden agenda.	
Then Fitch runs as an independent.	
Fitch has nothing to lose having alienated the party regulars.	
This provides a true conservative (Fitch) and a true old timey Business-As-Usual (Potts) for the voters to choose between.	
Potts gets the money from the Road Gang, Fitch gets energy and grass roots support from those who want fundamental change.	
Either one could get over 25.	
1% Kilgore and Kaine are left with the party regulars.	
This is a problem because as the two "major" parties have fine tuned their ability to win two-way races by 51% they become more vulnerable to attacks from someone outside the club.	
By avoiding the issues that will cause them to lose rather than stressing what they stand for, the "major" parties have shrunk their tent and have fewer active members as a percentage of eligible voters.	
In fact both are minority parties, especially if you count those who do not bother to vote.	
Could be interesting.

T19:35:00 It's an intriguing scenario.	
At this point, I'm sure Fitch would disavow any interest in running as an independent.	
But the possibilities are intriguing.	
Another factor working in his favor as an independent -- but not as a Republican -- is the fact that he would have the strongest environmental platform of the bunch.	
Being an environmentalist doesn't do much for you in the Republican Party, but, in theory, it should help him cut into a core constituency of the Democratic Party. (I say, in theory, because I believe that most environmentalists are Democrats first, environmentalists second.	
There's very little difference between the environmental policies of Gilmore and Warner, but the environmentalists lobbyists who vilified Gilmore have been remarkably quiet about Warner.) Phil Rodokanakis ?

This would defeat the entire notion of a Polical Party primary contest.

Attorney General John Ashcroft, for example, is a career politician.

Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge is another career politician who was passed over by Mr. Bush for the vice presidency.	
And Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Asa Hutchinson is yet another career politician and a graduate of the disgraceful Bob Jones University.	
Apparently, Mr. Bush only turns to professionals when it's really important, like political consulting.	
NOVAK Paul, as I understand your definition of a political -- of a professional politician based on that is somebody who is elected to public office.	
Now in your administration, the Clinton administration, there were these members of the cabinet who by your definition were professional politicians -- Lloyd Bentsen, Les Aspin, William S. Cohen, Janet Reno, Bruce Babbitt, Mike Espy, Dan Glickman, Norman Mineta, Henry Cisneros, Federico Pena, Bill Richardson, Richard Riley, 12 of them, not to mention former Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown, and one of the great professional politicians of all time, Bill Daly.

It's OK to put Democratic career politicians at the Pentagon and the Justice Department if they're Democrats but not if they're Republicans, is that right?

Surely Chris Dodd is at least more credible than Carol Moseley-Braun or Dennis Kucinich.

I guess that means harassing Tom Ridge, fighting tax cuts and obstructing President Bush's plans to reform judiciary.

One of his aides tells the current issue of "TIME," magazine, quote, "even if it's $500 billion, so what?"	
Of course, even a $500 billion deficit number doesn't count the $3 trillion Mr. Bush is robbing from the Social Security trust fund.	
You know, we should have known, every time George W. Bush gets in trouble, he borrows from a trust fund.	
It's been his whole life, you know.	
NOVAK Let me give you two economic facts of like, which you should know, even if you won't recognize them.	
Number one, there is absolutely no relationship between the deficit and unemployment.	
They don't go together.	
And number two, there is no Social Security fund, Virginia .	Virginia PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780803" id="Pl-7" latLong="37.500°N 78.500°W" state="US-VA" type="CIVIL"

BEGALA Bob, one of the reasons I think so many Americans are worried about this war and so many people around the world don't want to go is there have been a lot of problems with credibility from this administration.	
Our president has repeatedly, for example, relied on a man whom you're aware, Hussein Kamel, Saddam Hussein's son-in-law, leader of the Iraq arms program who defected for a time.	Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
And gave us a whole lot of information and then went home and his father-in-law killed him.	
Bad move.	
But while he was here, he gave us a whole lot of information.	
Gave us a whole lot of information.	
Well, our president told us that information proves that the dictator had chemical weapons, which is true.	
But what we just learned this week from "Newsweek" magazine which got a hold of the debriefings, is that he also told us it was destroyed back in 1995.	
Why hasn't our president told us that?	
Why do we have to learn it from "Newsweek"?	
DORNAN I don't believe that he believed it was all destroyed.	
The fact that this guy was such an idiot to go back and let his father-in-law kill him shows he wasn't the most stable of people.	
But the things that.	
.. that..	
. that...	
BEGALA Good point.	
But shouldn't our president have told us what the CIA told him.	
Why do we learn from "Newsweek?"Should he level with us?	
DORNAN Paul, look, the problem is I would stipulate all four of us hates war.	
Any rational person hates war.	
Bush isn't sitting in that White House not thinking about the body bags coming home with great young men.	
Clinton suffered greatly over the 19 Rangers that died, 18 on the 3rd of October and Matt Reersen (ph) three days later.	
I visited all their families.	
I was at the medal of honor ceremony for the kids.	
Let me tell you, what trips to Walter Reed taught me was, that whoever thought up the term, the law of unintended consequences it pertains to war.	
I am shook over the aftermath.	
But, this guy is a monster, a mini-me Hitler.	
He will blow a city off the earth in a minute if he can get the hold of the means to do it.	
NOVAK Tom Andrews, I think we all realize that a government doesn't go to war a nation goes to war.	nation PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-15" type="COUNTRY"
And so I would like you to take a look at the CNN "USA TODAY" Gallup poll, taken last week, should U.S. troops to go to Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein from power.

Take a look at it.	
Favor 59%, opposed 37%, that's a vastly larger support than President Bush Senior had in getting the U.S. troops out of Kuwait before that war started.

That's pretty good support isn't it?	
ANDREWS Now, Bob, come on you don't really buy this.	
I mean, listen, this is the oldest trick in the book.	
You can have a general question like this that could mean anything and ask people and they give you what comes off the top of their head.	
But, ask them another question, ask them what they think about spending $1.3 trillion in destroying this economy.	
Ask them about going and not just a war, Bob, but an invasion and occupying for up to 10 years a sovereign Arab nation in the midst of one of the most distable and volatile regions in the world.	nation PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-15" type="COUNTRY"
Ask them how they feel about getting bogged down.	
Well, I've seen some of the figures.	
Once you start telling Americans the story, -- the administration refuse today tell us story.	
They're not coming forward and telling us what the risks are, what the costs are, how many years we might be in, the possibility of us getting bogged down, because what Americans know that, they're opposed to this war.	
The more they learn about this invasion, the more they learn about this occupation, the less they support it.	
DORNAN Tom, you know what liberals want.	
They don't want a smoking gun, they want a smoking city.	
The Clinton people all say.	
.. say..

BEGALA That's going to have to be last war, unfair and unfortunate as that is, I am sorry, they're telling us we're out of time.

And it spans his life from the depression era to the Clinton era.	
Let's ask him which was more depressing.	
BEGALA First, thank you for writing this book.	
It is extraordinary.	
It is wonderful.	
And then we read you one passage.	
You cite a session you had with President Lyndon Johnson in Austin , I guess, at his ranch , right?	Austin PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:30010462" id="Pl-4" state="TX" type="PPLA"
Here is what you quote our President Johnson to you.	
"When I was majority leader, and later president, I spent all my time pulling every power string I could find to pull, trying to pass bills that helped people.	
That made their lives better and the country stronger.	country PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-13" type="COUNTRY"
That's what the Democrats stand for." "Republicans?	
Republicans just stand for two things: protecting the rich and investigation Democrats." That's true, though, isn't it?	
Johnson was right, wasn't he?	
BUMPER I thought that was one of the most prescient things I ever heard, and that was long before White Water.	
BEGALA Yes.	
He never heard of Ken Starr, but he anticipated it.	
BUMPERS Nothing ever changes, Paul.	
NOVAK Can I interrupt this Democratic picnic for just a minute?	
You know, Senator, inadvertently, you gave support in this book to one of my pet political themes, which you probably don't agree with.	
On page 256 you say, "As the years went by" -- this is when you were in the Senate -- "less and less information was new, fewer and fewer arguments were fresh, and the repetitiveness of the old arguments became tiresome."	
"I was becoming almost as cynical as my constituents.	
I knew it was time to leave."	
Isn't that a great argument for term limits?	
I know very few senators or any who are as good in their third term as they are in their first term.	
Shouldn't we limit them to two terms?	
BUMPERS First of all, that statement is not designed to cover everybody in the United States Senate.	United States PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" type="COUNTRY"
But I must say, that's a pretty accurate statement.	
But it has nothing do with term limits, in my opinion.	
I think term limits is the worst idea I ever heard of.	
(APPLAUSE) BEGALA Amen.	
NOVAK I tried at least.	
BEGALA Let me turn one more page, to page 257, actually, right next door to where Bob was reading.	
This struck me because you've got the courage to say something that is heretical today and it's music to my ears.	
You say, "Partisanship has taken on an odious connotation, and it may indeed be shriller now than ever.	
But we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that we have two political parties so people will have choices.	
If everybody agreed on everything, it might be a tranquil society, but it surely would be a dole one, and certainly not certainly a good one."	
BUMPERS You know, Paul, that's the reason we have two parties, so people have a choice.	
And I've said many times, if we all agreed on everything, everybody would want to marry Betty and we would really be in a mess, wouldn't we, Bob?	
NOVAK Senator Bumpers, of the 22 senators of the old confederacy, when I got to Washington with the Associated Press, 45 years ago, 22 of them were Democrats, nine were Republicans.	Washington PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-6" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="DC" type="PPL"
Now 13 are Republicans and nine are Democrats.	
And of the Democrats, I don't think there is a real liberal.	
Your last year in the Senate I had an interview with you and I wrote a column called "The Last Southern Liberal." BUMPERS And I thank you.	Southern PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208921051" id="Pl-8" type="RGN",South PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208921051" id="Pl-11" type="RGN"
It was a very flattering article, Bob.	
NOVAK And you said, I'll quote it, you said, today's Southern voters are "children of Democrats who are not swayed by the same things their mothers and fathers were.	Southern PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208921051" id="Pl-8" type="RGN",South PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208921051" id="Pl-11" type="RGN"
They certainly are susceptible to the Republican message."	
That's a good future for the Democratic Party in the South .	South PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208921051" id="Pl-11" type="RGN"
BUMPERS Bob, I think that the reason everybody in the south -- you know, first of all, we were -- when Franklin Roosevelt was elected president, we had been living what we thought was still a conquered nation after the Civil War.	
And we felt that Franklin Roosevelt was the first person who ever really acknowledged that the South had peculiar problems.	South PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208921051" id="Pl-11" type="RGN"
And from that time on, that's the reason we had 22 Democratic senators from 11 confederate states, is because of the Civil War and because of what we thought was a heavy hand of the federal government all the time.	
Of course there was always that old story about the Yankees, and Yankees were synonymous with Republicans.	
But that's all changed and memories have dimmed.	
And people, you know, they don't remember that.	
And so the message, the Republicans have actually had a golden opportunity to make their case and they've done it successfully.	
And the Democrats need desperately to get a message to counter that, and they need to get a message and stay on it.	
I mean we cannot be all over the lot.	
(CROSSTALK) NOVAK (UNINTELLIGIBLE) they're just not buying the new deal anymore in the South .	South PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208921051" id="Pl-11" type="RGN"
Isn't that the truth?	
BUMPERS Well, that's true.	
They're not buying a new deal.	
But I'll tell you the message the Democrats ought to be -- that every time we get sort of within the grasp of the golden age, I mean within reach of the golden age, where everybody has health care, where everybody gets a good education -- you know I'm one of the million and a half people -- my brother went to Harvard, I went to Northwestern University.	
Two schools my father couldn't have even thought about affording.	
A million and a half veterans came out of War World II on the GI bill and got that kind of an education.	
If that makes me a liberal, because I believe the government has a role to play in that, then I am a certified liberal, because I think that made the country stronger.	country PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-13" type="COUNTRY"
I think certainly it made every one of those people stronger, and I think we ought to be doing it right now.	
No child in this country ought to be deprived of an education for lack of money.	country PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-13" type="COUNTRY"
No elderly person ought to have to make a choice between food and medicine.	
And they do it by the millions every day.	
And now..	
. now...	
(APPLAUSE) BEGALA Will you run for president?	
I'll chair a committee.	
Dale Bumpers for president, ladies and gentlemen.

RALPH NADER, CONSUMER ADVOCATE Another one of your leading questions.	
This is a medical malpractice crisis.	
Over 80,000 Americans, 220 every day die from medical negligence, hundred of thousands are injured.	American PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY",America PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-4" type="COUNTRY"
And the insurance companies which had relatively steady rates on doctors for about 10 years have found its investment income, its interest income, the stock market collapse down.	
And so they're jacking up the rates on a few key specialties like obstetricians and neurosurgeons.	
But if you take the entire amount of premiums, Bob, that's paid by doctors in this country to malpractice insurers and divide it evenly, they'd be paying less than $9,000 each.	country PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-7" type="COUNTRY"
That's one-third of what they pay a receptionist.	
NOVAK That runs against the fact that so many of them are just leaving their practice because they can't afford it.	
You know, Ralph, you and I often agree on some things and one thing I think we agree on is the dirty effect of money and politics.	
Can you say that the lawyers, the trial lawyers who appoint millions and millions of dollars into Democratic coffers in order to keep this, do you believe that this is healthy.	
.. healthy..	
. healthy...	
NADER Well, as much as they've poured into those coffers, it's much less than what the doctors, the malpractice insurers, the hospital chains and the HMOs and the nursing home chains have poured into members of Congress' coffers.	
This is first and foremost, Bob, a question of equity.	
Are we going to allow severely injured people who have found a lung taken out that's the wrong lung or a double mastectomy that wasn't indicated that was inflicted on a woman in the Midwest , or that organ transplant that was incompatible on that 17-year-old teenager in North Carolina .

The Congress is going to handcuff the judges and juries in the United States at the state court level?	United States PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-6" type="COUNTRY"
I haven't yet met one senator or representative who's for this bill who has demonstrated that the jurors in their home state and the judges in their home state are incompetent, unwilling or unable to perform justice in these medical malpractice cases.	
And I've never heard one person say that the insurance executives who make $250,000 a week, every week without any pain and suffering, no one is saying cap those.	
(APPLAUSE) BEGALA Dr. Palmisano, first thank you for being here.	
DR. DONALD PALMISANO, PRESIDENT-ELECT, AMA Thank you.	
Pleasure to be here.	
BEGALA There was a hear on Capitol Hill today.	Capitol Hill PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:530313" id="Pl-21" latLong="38.889°N 77.001°W" state="US-DC" type="PPL"
And, I want to ask you to respond to one of the witnesses, John McCormick testified today.	
He's the father of a little girl, 13-month-old girl, who he said today died because of medical malpractice.	
He said that the hospital ignored abnormal CO2 levels in her blood.	
Said that the attending physician had slept through several pages.	
She died awaiting surgery.	
Listen to what Mr. McCormick said and I'll ask you to respond.	
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN MCCORMICK, FATHER OF MALPRACTICE VICTIM Mr. President, from father to father, my family's pain and suffering are not frivolous.	
(END VIDEO CLIP) BEGALA Isn't he right?	
Isn't our president wrong to be -- did he win the Lottery?	
You know, Mr. Bush -- President Bush says these guys have won the litigation Lottery.	
Does that look like a Lottery winner to you, holding a picture of his dead baby?	
PALMISANO Well, the current medical liability system is affecting patients in that they can't get access to care.	
The American Medical Association works very hard to make safety a priority in the medical care system.	American PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY",America PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-4" type="COUNTRY"
That's why we founded the National Patient Safety Foundation.	
The current system doesn't measure negligence.	
It measures disability.	
And what we're finding now is that the emergency rooms are closing, trauma centers are closing, pregnant women can't find a doctor to deliver the baby, a boy knocked unconscious has to be transported to another state.	
Another witness today told of what happened to her husband because there were no longer neurosurgeons available in the community.	
The patient had to be airavacked and by that time it was too late to prevent the brain damage.	
BEGALA Those are important points, I don't doubt.	
PALMISANO Yes.	
BEGALA But I wonder if you can respond to Mr. McCormick's point.	
Who are you, who's our president to tell him that his suffering is only worth $250,000 for the loss of a child?	
PALMISANO Well, what has to be done here is balance.	
What we need is a system that's fair to everyone, a system that keeps the physicians in practice and allows patients to have access to physicians in their hour of need.	
And the system in California that's in the bill, in Congress now, HR-5, that's a system that has worked.	California PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780778" id="Pl-27" latLong="37.250°N 119.750°W" state="US-CA" type="PPL"

And in some states, for example, there are doctors that are -- you know, there are 45 payouts in ten years and they're not disciplined by the state medical board.	
I mean, you've got 5 percent of the doctors accounting for over 55 percent of the payoffs, Paul.	
In other words a small percentage of doctors that are bad, incompetent, indifferent, whatever.	
They're not performing properly and the AMA is not cracking down, is not supporting expansion to state licensing..	
. (CROSSTALK) PALMISANO I want to respond to that.	
The National Practitioner Data Bank is the source of the information and it was brought up today.	
First of all, the Government Accounting Office criticized the methodology used.	
It lists multiple claims against one physician when actually it's really one claim, different insurers pay on the same physician and it's counted as one claim.	
It doesn't mention whether they are obstetricians, neurosurgeons or emergency medicine.	
It doesn't list that.	
Right now in South Florida , in South Florida , the latest poll shows that every neurosurgeon has been sued.

 Interview With Ralph Nader, Donald Palmisano; Interview With	
NOVAK Welcome back.	
Both the AMA and the Bush administration released reports this week saying out of control trial lawyers are driving doctors out of their practices all across the country . President Bush points this way today, even the most frivolous of lawsuits cost money, premiums go up and either way, the patient pays.	country PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-9" type="COUNTRY"
We're debating malpractice reform with consumer advocate Ralph Nader, and AMA President-Elect Dr. Ronald Palmisano.	
BEGALA Dr. Palmisano, again, thanks for staying with us through the break.	
Let me set aside the hypocrisy of a man who became president because of a lawsuit trying to eliminate everybody else's lawsuits, but instead focus on his own experience.	
He was the governor of my state of Texas , where there are a whole lot of doctors.	Texas PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780801" id="Pl-3" latLong="31.250°N 99.250°W" predicative="true" state="TX" type="CIVIL"

Here's what the " Dallas Morning News" reported recently: "The Texas State Board of Medical Examiners, the agency that pledges to protect the public has granted second and third chances to surgeons who are thrown out of hospitals because they botched operations.	Dallas PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1381944" id="Pl-4" latLong="32.783°N 96.800°W" predicative="true" state="US-TX" type="PPL",Texas PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780801" id="Pl-3" latLong="31.250°N 99.250°W" predicative="true" state="TX" type="CIVIL"
It has forgiven physicians who overlook cancerous tumors, who maimed infants or whose mistakes left women sterilized.	
It has refused in the last five years to revoke the license of a single doctor for committing medical errors.	
Thousands more may have been ignored over the last decade."	
That is the Bush record in policing surgeons, why should we trust him now?	
PALMISANO Well, first off.	
.. off..	
. off...	
BEGALA Physicians generally, not just surgeons, forgive me.	
PALMISANO Sure.	
What we need to do is to make sure that state boards, number one, have adequate funding.	
The AMA supports that.	
If there are any bad doctors we want them removed from the practice of medicine.	
But it's also..	
. (CROSSTALK) BEGALA ... bad doctors?	
PALMISANO Well, it's also unfair to make a judgment without knowing all of the facts of the case.	
Because someone pays money in a case, the insurance company may pay money because they're afraid there's is going to be a giant award in this case because of this broken liability system.	
Troy Brennan (ph) of Harvard said there's no correlation with negligence, only with disability.	
So let's look at all of the facts, but give everybody due process here in America before we criticize.	America PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" type="COUNTRY"
NADER Actually, Troy Brennan, the same doctor at Harvard Public School of Health said the issue is not to fuel lawsuits, it's too many.	
Less than 10 percent of the victims of medical malpractice, and we're talking about horrific injuries here, even file a claim.	
Even file a claim.	
And the entire pay-out to all of the victims that get a little money, not the 90 percent who never file a claim, amounts to less than what we spend on dog food.	
On dog food.	
It's about $5.4 billion is the pay-out.	
That's a fraction of physician income.	
It's a fraction of the health care expense of 1.4 trillion.	
PALMISANO What we have to do is look at all the facts and have balance here.	
That's what the people in Congress have to do.	
They have to make sure that whatever they decide keeps doctors in practice and patients having access to care.	
NADER Doctors are going.	
.. going..	
. going...	
PALMISANO But let me - but let me - wait.	
.. wait..	
. wait...	
NADER Doctors are leaving practice because of insurance premium, right?	
Is that right?	
They don't abandon their patients, except for the high premiums of a few specialties?	
PALMISANO Because of the premiums.	
But first of all let me.	
.. me..	
. me...	
NADER Why don't you crack down on the insurance companies?	
PALMISANO No.	
Let's talk about the facts.	
Let's talk about the facts.	
NADER That's the fact.	
PALMISANO (UNINTELLIGIBLE) percent of the doctors are insured by physician-owned insurance companies, the medical side.	
I was just in Oklahoma , they own this insurance company.	Oklahoma PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1103857" id="Pl-6" latLong="35.500°N 97.500°W" state="US-OK" type="CIVIL"
They are trying to do their very best.	
It's a company not for profit.	
What happens here is that more money is being paid out than comes in.	
And as far as the investment income, A.M. Bests (ph) show that in the past five years, the investment income has been stable at around 5 percent.	
Brown Brothers Harriman said that investments did not precipitate the current crisis.	
(CROSSTALK) NADER ... payoffs have been stable, adjusted for inflation, National Practitioners Databank (ph).	National PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-8" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
Why do you want that to be secret?	
All of the information about bad doctors in the National Practitioner bank, you, the AMA wants to keep it secret from other doctors and other patients around the country who want to know whether their doctor is on that list.

NOVAK Well, let's look at what the president is actually proposing for people who have been harmed by a bad doctor.	
Let's listen to what he said to the AMA today.	
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BUSH If harmed by a doc, they ought to be able to recover their economic costs, economic losses.	
They should be able to recover non- economic damages as well.	
But for the sake of the system, non- economic damages should be capped at $250,000. (END VIDEO CLIP) NOVAK What in the world is wrong with that?	
Tell me what's wrong with that?	
NADER What's wrong?	
Tell someone who had a double mastectomy, tell an infant who's brain-damaged and has no economic loss that for the rest of their lives they're going to get dribbled out $250,000 for their entire life expectancy?	
Wait a minute.	
The head of AIG a few years ago was making $250,000 every week.	
NOVAK Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money, though.	
Not for you, but for most people it's a lot of money.	
(CROSSTALK) NADER These executives, why don't you tell.

NOVAK No, no, no.	
I've got to ask Mr. Nader, we are almost out of time.	
Doug Friedman (ph), who ran Jesse Ventura's campaign for governor four years ago, says he wants you to run for president again.	
I know you're saying it's much too early to run for president.	
But one simple question, Ralph, will you consider another run for president?	
NADER Much too early to consider.	
I am concerned about Donald Zook (ph), who's head of a medical malpractice insurance company, a big one in the West , saying that his insurance company executive colleagues should not blame the tort injury system.	West PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-15" mod="W" type="COUNTRY"
He said that your problem of jacking up these insurance rates is self-inflicted.	
Here's an insurance company executive who is saying that.	
PALMISANO Well, Mr. Zook is one executive you are quoting.	
What we need to do is look at all of the people who don't have doctors.	
.. doctors..	
. doctors...	
NADER Hey, let's get some agreement.	
Should we get some agreement?	
PALMISANO What..	
. NADER Do you want to really crack down on the bad doctors?	
PALMISANO We want to crack down on the attorneys who file frivolous suits.	
NADER Fine.	
Fine.	
PALMISANO Seventy percent of the cases filed are told there's no payment.	
What kind of peer review is that?	
NADER Wait.	
Wait.	
Do you want to crack down on the bad doctors?	
You're in AMA.	
PALMISANO We definitely want to crack down on bad doctors.	
But...(CROSSTALK) NADER Do you want to control insurance rates?	
PALMISANO We want the free market to dictate what is done.

I think it does.	
I think it has described him, especially since he's taken basically a one-man rule over with the Baath Party in 1979.

NOVAK And it also proves you can even chew gum and walk at the same time.	
Doesn't it show that?	
BEGALA He cannot eat a pretzel and watch a football became at the same time.	
So I'm still doubtful of -- no, here's why.	
This is a serious point and you deserve a serious answer.	
The way we caught that guy was by coordinating with our allies.	
We now have a foreign policy in Iraq that is putting enormous strain on those allies.	Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY"

It's not a United Nations question.	
BEGALA That is correct.	
The president has got all of the legal authorities he needs.	
I just pray to god he doesn't use it.	
We need to go to the U.N. because we want to build coalitions so we have support around the world and so that we don't have to carry the burden ourselves.

PAUL BEGALA, CNN CO-HOST Hello, everybody.	
Welcome to CROSSFIRE.	
On this Ash Wednesday, the pope asks Catholics to fast for peace and he asks President Bush to work for peace, while the White House sends out Colin Powell to make yet another case for war.	
We will debate all of that as well as "Vanity Fair"'s latest, stunning revelations about Michael Jackson.	
Believe it or not, we got new news on Michael Jackson.	
Do you think he really looks like a mummy?	
Certainly not a daddy.	
But first, our own little moonwalk across the political landscape, the "CROSSFIRE Political Alert." The foreign ministers of France , Germany and Russia today issued a joint declaration that they will not allow a second American -backed resolution to pass the United Nations Security Council.	France PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18572019" id="Pl-9" latLong="46.000°N 2.000°E" type="COUNTRY",America PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-7" type="COUNTRY",American PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-6" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY",Russia PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-16" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" type="COUNTRY",Germany PLACE country="DE" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18224345" id="Pl-15" latLong="51.500°N 10.500°E" type="COUNTRY"
President Bush wants the Security Council to explicitly authorize force against Iraq , and his press secretary today remained optimistic that in the end, that's just what he'll get.	Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
President Bush is said to be focusing on one fence-sitting Security Council member, the African nation of Guinea , because he said -- quote -- "I used to have one of their pigs."	Guinea PLACE country="GN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18819617" id="Pl-19" latLong="11.000°N 10.000°W" type="COUNTRY"
So -- OK, I made that up.	
He didn't say that.	
TUCKER CARLSON, CNN CO-HOST Well, I suspected that.	
You know.	
.. know..

BEGALA But they are a swing vote.	
Guinea is an important swing vote.	Guinea PLACE country="GN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18819617" id="Pl-19" latLong="11.000°N 10.000°W" type="COUNTRY"

We don't need war.	
They're not pointing out that inspections are working only because there's the credible threat of war.	
Saddam wouldn't be destroying missiles unless he thought he was going to be destroyed if he didn't.	
BEGALA I think that's a good point.	
It doesn't mean we have to go to war.	
But I think President Bush should get credit for pushing to instructions and backing them up with the threat of force.	
CARLSON It means when you take the threat of force of the table, you're likely to stop disarming Saddam Hussein.	
BEGALA Yes, I'm not saying take the threat of force.	
I'm saying we don't need to use force right now.	
CARLSON Well, France and Germany would like to.	France PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18572019" id="Pl-9" latLong="46.000°N 2.000°E" type="COUNTRY",Germany PLACE country="DE" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18224345" id="Pl-15" latLong="51.500°N 10.500°E" type="COUNTRY"
Secretary of State Colin Powell today responded to Saddam Hussein's latest attempts to fool the world.	
Powell called Iraqi steps toward disarmament -- quote -- "too little, too late" gestures, meant to split international resolve to force Baghdad to give up its weapons of mass destruction.	Baghdad PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-23" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC",Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY",Iraqi PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-3" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
U.S. intelligence said Powell indicates Iraq has hidden equipment to produce al-Samoud 2 missiles, even as it destroys existing ones, missiles that until recently, it claimed not to have.	U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-21" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY",Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
Powell also revealed that Iraq is hiding chemical and biological weapons in poor neighborhoods around Baghdad .	Baghdad PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-23" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC",Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
In order to secure peace, Powell concluded, the international community must confront Saddam Hussein's refusal to disarm -- quote -- "here and now."	
So, there you have it.	
The essence of the American case for war against Saddam Hussein.	America PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-7" type="COUNTRY",American PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-6" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
The only question left: who do you believe?	
Secretary of State Colin Powell or France ?	France PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18572019" id="Pl-9" latLong="46.000°N 2.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
BEGALA No, the question is.	
.. is..	
. is...	
CARLSON That is the question.	
BEGALA Who do you believe: the Bush administration or your lying eyes?	
We are watching them destroy weapons, as the president says, Oh, that's just a hoax.	
CARLSON But Paul... BEGALA They are disarming.	
CARLSON No, no, no that's not what the president's saying.	
He's saying, the -- it's a hoax to the extent that those are only a small number of the weapons there.	
Keep in mind, these are weapons that Saddam Hussein, until recently, said he didn't even have.	
He's a liar.	
BEGALA Of course.	
CARLSON And to trust Saddam Hussein in effort to disarm him -- foolish task, don't you think?	
BEGALA Absolutely.	
Nobody trusts Saddam Hussein.	
The question is, Is he a sufficient threat to America today to risk the lives of our young men and women.	America PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-7" type="COUNTRY"
CARLSON That's a separate question.	
That's a very separate question.	
BEGALA I think he's not.	
I think the inspections can work.	
CARLSON That's a different argument.	
We can take it up later.

BEGALA Well, those of you who still believe the myth of the liberal media should consider this: MSNBC, an obscure cable channel, has fired Phil Donahue, the host of its highest-rated show.	
A memo from inside NBC, reported on the Web site allyourtv.com, and today in "The Washington Post," shows NBC big wigs feared that the liberal Mr. Donahue represented in the words of the NBC memo -- quote -- "a difficult public face for NBC at a time of war, while our competitors are waving the flag at every opportunity because he seems to delight in presenting guests who are anti-war, anti-Bush and skeptical of the administration's motives."	
So there it is, according to NBC.	
Phil Donahue was fired because he's a liberal.	
In fact, the only liberal with the solo cable talk show.	
NBC, of course, is a division of the conglomerate GE, where they apparently only bring right wing things to life.	
CARLSON I actually like Phil Donahue.	
I've interviewed him a number of times.	
His arguments are really dumb.	
I don't know if you've listened to Phil Donahue.	
Delightful guy, but his arguments don't make a lot of sense and I think that is the problem with liberal talk show hosts -- you excluded, of course, and James.	
But the arguments, actually, don't hold up very well.	
Have you noticed that?	
BEGALA You know, you can argue back and forth, but you shouldn't fire someone because of their political views and that's what NBC has done and shame on the General Electric corporation.	
He had the highest-rated show on the network.	
CARLSON Which is saying what?	
BEGALA I used to work there.	
They're good to me.	
They're very nice people and they're very good to me.	
.. me..	
. me...	
CARLSON OK, OK, I'm not beat up on MSNBC.	
BEGALA ...but they shouldn't fire a guy for his political views.

CARLSON Former Illinois Senator Carol Moseley-Braun recently decided to run for president.	
Early reviews have not been good, so yesterday she announced she'll be making some changes.	
Not to her ideas, which are few.	
Not to her record, which is pretty embarrassing.	
Not even to her staff, which is, of course, tiny.	
But to her name.	
From here on out, Carol Moseley-Braun as Carol Moseley Braun.	
Did you catch the difference?	
In the second version, there is no hyphen between her last names.	
Moseley Braun expects that primary voters in Iowa and New Hampshire will react enthusiastically to this radical, grammatical transformation.	New Hampshire PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780794" id="Pl-2" latLong="43.667°N 71.500°W" state="US-NH" type="CIVIL",Iowa PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780785" id="Pl-3" latLong="42.000°N 93.500°W" state="US-IA" type="CIVIL"
They'll have to, because the latest CNN poll shows Moseley Braun far behind the candidate she set out to discredit.	
That would be, of course, the honorable Al Sharpton.	
Sharpton is not only by far the first choice of black voters nationally, he is tied with Senator John Edwards among all voters and beating Governor Howard Dean, Representative Dennis Kucinich and Senator Bob Graham.	
Beating them.	
And Al Sharpton didn't even have to change his name.	
BEGALA How did he become honorable?	
CARLSON Yes!	
(CROSSTALK) BEGALA You become honorable by winning an election of some sort or having a high post, being an ambassador or a governor or some thing.	
CARLSON By embodying the values of your party.	
BEGALA Your values, not mine.	
CARLSON He's the No. 1 pick, the most popular, among all candidates, among black primary voters.	
I mean, you can't dismiss him.	
He's a serious candidate.	
BEGALA We haven't even begun the primaries.	
He's not a serious candidate.	
He's right wing fantasy and it's never going to happen.	
CARLSON Not right wing.	
Take Al Sharpton seriously, that's our message tonight.	
In a moment, we'll ask two members of Congress if they're convinced that war is the only way to make Saddam Hussein disarm.	
Later, the pope practices religion and a little anti-war politics on the side.	
Then, can you spell prosthetic nose?	
Maureen Orth can, and she does in a new "Vanity Fair" profile of Michael Jackson.	
We'll talk to her.	
You won't want to miss that.	
We'll be right back.

Secretary of State Colin Powell goes to the U.N. tomorrow to do what he can.	
We're talking with potential war in Iraq with Congressman Charlie Rangel, a New York Democrat and his fellow New Yorker Republican Congressman Peter King.

BEGALA Mr. King, thanks for stying with us through the break.	
One of the reasons that we like having you on, and as well as Mr. Rangel, is that, you know, this is war, as we were saying in the last segment.	
You treat it with the gravity and the seriousness that it deserves.	
And you're a congressman who has put his constituents and his country ahead of his partisan interests.	country PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-16" type="COUNTRY"
So I wonder if you'll join Charlie Rangel, who put out a press release today, decrying the Republican attempt to hijack a bill to help our servicemen to use it to give special interest tax breaks to corporations.	
Isn't that wrong in a time of war?	
KING The important thing is that the bill pass for the military.	
If the other stuff's in there, it's there.	
I mean to me, the main purpose should be the military.	
I'm not going to disagree with Charlie's point.	
On the other hand, often when bills are passed, there are things attached to them.	
So to me, the key thing is that we ought to be taking care of the military and that's what we should do.	
CARLSON Congressman Rangel, a couple of months ago Senator Daschle on CBS said -- made the charge that we are, quote, "we haven't made any real progress in the war against al Qaeda."	
A lot of Democrats said similar things.	
This weekend Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the No. 2 member of al Qaeda and another significant al Qaeda member were captured in Rawalpindi , Pakistan .	Rawalpindi PLACE country="PK" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17227415" id="Pl-10" latLong="33.600°N 73.067°E" state="US-PB" type="PPL",Pakistan PLACE country="PK" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17229029" id="Pl-15" latLong="30.000°N 70.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
Doesn't it turn out that Mr. Daschle and others didn't know what they were talking about and maybe they shouldn't make charges like that in public when they don't know what they were talking about?	
You would agree with that, wouldn't you?	
RANGEL If they don't have the pencil that's keeping score, they ought to keep their mouth shut because as a former federal prosecutor, every drug dealer I busted was the most important drug dealer in the world.	
You just pass out numbers on whoever you arrest.	
Why was he No. 3?	
Why wasn't he No. 4?	
CARLSON Well, I don't know.	
Because he helped plan the attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon ?	
I think that puts you pretty high up in the organization.	
(CROSSTALK) RANGEL Let me tell you, when you arrest somebody, you describe who you're arresting.	
I haven't the slightest clue who this guy was.	
CARLSON I haven't heard anybody suggest that he's not one of the central figures in al Qaeda.	
Have you?	
RANGEL Listen, we should be arresting a lot of people.	
But I think the main thing that we have now is we should concentrate on Osama bin Laden, we should concentrate on dismantling Saddam Hussein.	
We should do all of those things, but the most important thing is we should not have the arrogance to have a preemptive strike against a defenseless nation without the.	nation PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-12" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY"

How are they defenseless?

Well, Chad, that's what liberals assume.	
That Europe is against the war on humanitarian and moral grounds, but the U.S. is for the war because it wants to profit for the oil companies.	U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-20" type="COUNTRY"

BEGALA I don't believe for a minute that this is a war for oil.	
I think it's unwise, it's unjust, it's unwarranted, but I don't think it's about oil.

This morning, at 8:36, a former employee opened fire in the auto supply warehouse where he once worked.	
As a result, six people have been murdered.	
The Chicago Police Department extends its sympathy to the families of the victims.	Chicago PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:424587" id="Pl-5" latLong="41.850°N 87.650°W" state="IL" type="PPL"
And going forward, our thoughts and prayers are with them as they cope with this senseless tragedy.	
I would also like to praise the heroic police officers who responded in a timely and professional manner to this tragedy.	
Let me tell you what we know at this time, as our investigation continues.	
At 8:37 this morning, 9th District officers responded to a call of shots fired at Windy City Supply, located at 3912 South Wallace (ph).	3912 South Wallace PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-7" state="IL" type="ROAD",Wallace PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-10" state="IL" type="ROAD",Windy City PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:424587" id="Pl-6" latLong="41.850°N 87.650°W" state="IL" type="PPL"
As officers arrived, they encountered a witness who had been tied up by the offender and escaped.	
He told the officers that a former employee had shot five employees.	
And, at this time, officers attempted to enter the building and the offender fired three shots at the officers.	
The officers took cover behind their squad cars.	
And the offender came out and was ordered to drop his gun.	
He refused and again fired at the officers.	
The officers fired back.	
And the offender went back into the building . Approximately one minute later, he came back out and again exchanged fire with the police.	
Our HBT officers then arrived on the scene.	
And based on the information that there was wounded citizens inside, they were ordered to make an assault on the building .	
When the HBT officers entered the building, the offender refused to drop his weapon and an HBT officer shot him.	
At that time, the offender was handcuffed.	
Paramedics were already on the scene.	
He was taken to the hospital , where he was pronounced dead.	
Inside, there was six victims who were all -- four were pronounced at the scene and two were pronounced at the hospital.	
Questions.	
QUESTION (OFF-MIKE) When was he fired or was he actually terminated (OFF-MIKE) CLINE According to management, he was fired approximately six months ago for being a poor employee, late, not showing up to work, causing trouble at work.	
QUESTION Had he come back, Phil, in the intervening days and weeks (OFF-MIKE) CLINE Through our interviews today, we know that there was some phone calls with him and one of the owners.	
But no reports were ever made.	
And, like I said, our investigation is still continuing as we speak here.	
We're not aware of him having any in-person encounters with any of the former people, but that could change as our interviews continue.	
QUESTION ... any indication that some of the victims were targeted, or was it random?	
CLINE Well, we know that he tied up the one victim inside and started killing the other victims.	
So we're not sure why he didn't shoot that victim.	
That's something that, hopefully, our investigation will uncover today.	
QUESTION Were the others tied up also?	
CLINE No, just the one person was tied up.	
That was it.	
QUESTION How many people work there?	
CLINE Well, on a given day, there should be nine people there.	
So eight were there.	
And one employee was late because of the expressway conditions with an accident this morning on the Eisenhower .	Eisenhower PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-8" state="IL" type="ROAD"
QUESTION Six of the eight were killed.	
CLINE Six of the eight were killed.	
One was tied up inside, escaped.	
As he was leaving, he encountered the other employee coming in.	
They're the ones that both ran to 39th and Wallace and called the police.	39th PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-9" state="IL" type="ROAD",Wallace PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-10" state="IL" type="ROAD"
QUESTION How did the person tied up get out?	
CLINE He got up and his hands were still tied behind his back, but was able to get out.	
QUESTION And were the owner (OFF-MIKE) Who survived?	
(OFF- MIKE) CLINE Let me just tell you right now, we have contacted family members.	
We're bringing them to the medical examiner's office.	
So we're not going to identify anybody until we have positive identifications by the family members.	
QUESTION Bill, can you tell us, did he (OFF-MIKE) these people (OFF-MIKE) or did he just walk in and start mowing them down?	
CLINE From the scene, it appears that he went throughout the supply warehouse shooting them.	
They weren't all in one section .	
They were in different sections of the warehouse . QUESTION We understand they were shot in the head.	
Is that true?	
CLINE There again, once they're posted, we'll know exactly where all their injuries were.	
But they all suffered fatal gunshot wounds, yes.	
QUESTION Did he make any statements that the witness heard while this was going on?	
CLINE No.	
Not that we've been told so far.	
QUESTION Did he say anything to the officers?	
CLINE No.	
CLINE Yes.	
Right now, like I said, there are shell casings from the police officers, shell casings from him at the scene.	
Our crime lab is going through all that.	
We know he had at least one extra clip.	
It was a Walther PP 380 semiautomatic pistol.	
QUESTION So he exchanged fire with police twice outside?	
CLINE Yes.	
QUESTION Before being shot himself.	
CLINE Right.	
CLINE He's been arrested a total of 12 times.	
And he has -- two times, he was arrested for carrying a gun.	
Two times, he was arrested for aggravated assault, four domestic batteries.	
And then the other ones are traffic and other miscellaneous charges.	
CLINE He was a laborer working there.	
The building itself was very hard for our HBT officers, because it's a warehouse . CARLSON OK, that's police in Chicago briefing the press on today's workplace shootings there.	Chicago PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:424587" id="Pl-5" latLong="41.850°N 87.650°W" state="IL" type="PPL"

MEYER Well, it all depends on your point of view.	
I mean, if I were a BBC representative, I would be telling you that my coverage of the war was entirely impartial.	
There has been a lot of hoo-hah and fisticuffs over the last two or three weeks between Number 10 Downing Street and the BBC about the coverage of the war.	
Some of this has calmed down a bit now.	
But we've been having fun and games in the last two or three weeks.	
But if you're saying to me, Has that been, in effect, a serious obstacle to the government getting over its message, I have to say, and I'm no longer representing the British government, I have to say I don't think that is the case.

SHIELDS Mr. Ambassador, as an Irish American who's never been accused of being an uncritical fan of all things British , I do stand in some admiration of the fact that your royals serve in the military, and, in fact, that the mortality rate among the British upper class and royalty in both world wars was higher than among the working classes.

MEYER Well, I -- you know, one of the things that I have never been able to do, and I regret it, is serve in our armed forces.	
I have been one of those who have benefited from the sacrifices of our parents and our grandparents.	
And my own father was a pilot in the Second World War, and was killed in action.	
But the tradition was always that officers lead from the front.	
They set an example to their men.	
And that is one of the enduring traditions of the British armed forces and of the British army.	British PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-13" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY"

DEARDOURFF The -- yes, the campaign in '76.	
Doug Bailey and I were certainly to the left of most of the Ford people and the Republican Party.	
Both of us had worked for Nelson Rockefeller, and frankly, were not happy that the Ford campaign had essentially pushed him out of the vice presidential candidacy in '76.	
And there were some policy differences that we had with Ford at that time.	
But -- and they, frankly, had been faced with the challenge from Reagan, weren't sure they wanted us involved in a campaign (UNINTELLIGIBLE).	
.. (UNINTELLIGIBLE)..	
. (UNINTELLIGIBLE)...	
HUNT Once you did get in, what was your impression of Gerald Ford?	
DEARDOURFF Well, let's -- once we got in, frankly, it was really character trumping all of our earlier concerns about President Ford.	
I mean, I came to believe that this man was one of the most decent, honorable, principled men I'd ever met in politics.	
And it was just a pleasure to work with him.	
HUNT In 1976, you were down by 30 points on Labor Day.	
You almost pulled it off, losing by about a point, with brilliant but simple and direct ads like this.	
Let's take a look.

(END VIDEO CLIP) HUNT Extraordinary campaign.	
Did you run out of gas, or did you need a couple more days?	
DEARDOURFF No, well, I think it was really a little bit of running out of gas.	
We had come -- we were gaining about a half a percentage point a day throughout the campaign.	
We just didn't quite have the juice to get over the top.	
The thing about that campaign that is so memorable to me is the way it was conducted by both campaigns.	
It really is the last time in American presidential campaign politics that the two candidates ended up liking each other much better after the campaign than they had before.

HUNT If President Ford hadn't pardoned Richard Nixon, would have won that election?	
DEARDOURFF I doubt it.	
I think that the Nixon trial, whatever would -- I mean, it would have stretched all through the Ford presidency.	
And I think Ford recognized that if he was going to have any chance of healing the wounds of Watergate, he had to get Nixon off center stage.	
HUNT What was Gerald Ford's most notable achievement as president?	
DEARDOURFF Well, I think that he restored some modicum of trust in the government.	
I mean, people's view of Washington and of the presidency was at such a low ebb, and Ford, largely through his own personality, was able to really lift up people's spirits.	Washington PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-9" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="DC" type="PPL"

HUNT It's been over 26 years since Gerald Ford left the presidency.	
He's going to be 90 years old next week.	
He's really been a pretty active and pretty contributory ex-president, hasn't he?	
DEARDOURFF He's been not -- more than -- I -- I mean, in my view, more importantly, he and Betty Ford have been the happiest of couples.	
I think those years in public life were hard on her and hard on him as a result.	
To see the two of them able to live out a life after politics and to be such useful contributors, both of them -- And of course the same thing is true with Jimmy Carter.	
I think they are wonderful examples of how to live your life after you're out of politics.	
HUNT John, thanks.	
Happy birthday to.	
.. to..

DEARDOURFF Absolutely.	
HUNT ... ex-president Ford... (END VIDEOTAPE) SHIELDS Al Hunt, since Gerald, Gerald, Ronald Reagan's emergence and dominance of the Republican Party in 1980, has Gerald Ford been estranged from prevailing Republican ideology?	
HUNT Well, certainly the party has moved to the right since then, Mark, but -- and it's interesting, Ford people dominated both the first Bush administration and dominate policy today, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Alan Greenspan, even though the party has moved to the right.	
But we just owe Gerry Ford on the eve of his 91st day a tremendous debt for what he did back in those tough times.

there's nothing to report on that front. we have just gotten word from the ninth circuit court of appeals that that court has now put on hold its ruling banning the pledge of allegiance in public classrooms. schools in nine western states would have been prohibited from having students say the pledge starting monday.	
the stay was granted to give the school districts involved in the initial cases 90 days to appeal to the u.s. supreme court here in washington . the appeals court ruled last summer, but the phrase under god which was ad ded to the pledge in the 1950s is an unconstitutional endorsement of religion.	washington PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-4" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="US-DC" type="PPL",u.s.

they rejected challenges to the law of sentences of 25 years to life without parole for a man convicted of stealing some golf clubs and 50 years for a man who stole some videotapes. the idea is if you have three felony convictions, you're out of here. the voters overwhelmingly passed the law in 1994 to offset the liberal and lenient judges to let bad people off with nothing more than a slap of the wrist.	
they appealed to the supreme court on behalf of these two people. currently in california , 7000 people serving 25 to year life sentences under the three strikes law. one-third of them -- not that.	california PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780778" id="Pl-3" latLong="37.250°N 119.750°W" state="US-CA" type="CIVIL"

with her family on a day when their miracle finally came true.	
she looks very, very healthy.	
she's grown a lot. and i'm just so absolutely thrilled. i couldn't believe it. in fact, i had to take a double take and pull her back away from me and say, "is it really you?" all of the children out there deserve to come home to their parents the way -- the way elizabeth has come back to us. and i just hope and pray that congress will quickly pass the amber alert so that those children will have a better chance because they cross the state line and they're out of commission. and we need to have this here.	
we really do.	
but i just am so grateful and so thankful. thank you very much. reporter: can you describe elizabeth's demeanor? you said she looked good, she was bigger, but she's been through this horrible ordeal. is she still scared?	
she excited? happy? i don't know. i mean, it was just -- i'm sure she was just thrilled to be back.	
i just -- such happiness and such love. and i just held her, held her the whole way home.	
i just brought her little brother william in. and as william and she saw each other, it was such a wonderful reunion for them to just hug, and they -- he would hug her and look at her and hug her and look at her. and couldn't believe, i think, as a 4-year-old now that his sister is home.	
with the darkness that surrounds us in these times of the possibility of war that could be coming upon us and a miracle that has been brought to us, an incredible miracle that has been brought to our family, words cannot express how grateful we are for the prayers around the world.	
do miracles still exist? and the answer is yes.	
and we have elizabeth back.	
this neighborhood , the federal heights neighborhood, everybody's been ripped up, everybody's helped, everybody's prayed to do whatever they can. we thank god for all the searchers, for all the people. in the history of the world i don't think a little girl's been prayed for more than elizabeth smart. and we thank you for answering those prayers. thank you.	neighborhood PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:170445" id="Pl-3" latLong="39.851°N 104.998°W" state="US-CO" type="PPL",federal heights PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:170445" id="Pl-4" latLong="39.851°N 104.998°W" predicative="true" state="US-CO" type="PPL"

were there opportunities perhaps that she might ab vible to -- able to get away from her abductors? the police are saying she was abducted by knife point and was an opportunity and may have been some kind of fear factor going on.	
we are seeing a lot locally here some photographs that are coming out that show the three, that show mitchell, his wife, and who they believe to be elizabeth smart at a party in september.

it gives you a sense of, perhaps what 50 years of tension and war will do to your mentality.	
but it does also say that the israelis are a bit more blase, if that's a fair word for it, than perhaps we are. president bush, when he talked earlier to reporters, mentioned that this effort is an effort, this war is an effort to make the homeland, our homeland, more secure.	
john king, that whole issue of homeland security must be so much on the minds of so many government officials, given the level of the terror alert today.	
reporter: so far, so good is the assessment we're getting from senior administration officials as they try to track what they worry about most. as we have the strikes overseas throughout iraq , there will be retaliatory terror strikes, either by organized terrorist networks or sympathetic terrorists or people against the united states in this country . so far, so good.	iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY",united states PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-10" type="COUNTRY",country PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-8" type="COUNTRY"

for some perspective, let's turn to miles o'brien with retired air force general don shepperd. thank you very much.	
if you are going to fight on the ground, you have to encounter bridges somewhere along the way. a lot of bridges between where the 3 7 cavalry and the rest of the u.s. forces are now and their ultimate destination, downtown baghdad . we have the city laid out for you here. how many bridges in this city alone? in this map we have right here, 13 major bridges in downtown baghdad , including the expressway bridge over here. three bridges here attaching east baghdad to west baghdad and the palace area.	baghdad PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" mod="W" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC",u.s.

this is one technique, one possible way u.s. forces might seize a bridge, a bridge that might be defended by iraqis. let's look at the animation. typical scenario there. it doesn't really matter for this scenario that we're laying out here.	iraqi PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-9" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY",u.s.

this would be representing m1-a1 tanks coming towards the bridge firing. you have to bundle up and line up to go across that bridge.	
makes it vulnerable to fire from the other side. potentially chemical weapons, too. as we turn the other direction, what you'll see are these iraqi tanks that are kind of fortified there. they have burns in front of them.	iraqi PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-9" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
artillery behind them firing back. and then they there goes the smoke screen. the idea of the smoke screen is to obscure the oncoming forces fire ing at you from being able to see.	
it doesn't work, though. it works both ways.	
it obscures you but also obscures them. here's an f-16.

there is also intelligence, officials say, suggesting republican guard units have been issued artillery shells containing chemical agents.	
there has been intelligence scraps, who knows how accurate they are, chatter in the system, that suggests that the closer that coalition forces get to baghdad and tikrit the greater the likelihood and that some command and control arrangements have been put in place. reporter: in baghdad deputy prime minister tariq aziz repeated his government's stand -- it does not have any kind of weapons of mass destruction. translator: when they started to talk about the weapons of mass destruction, we know and we always knew that that was fabrication and lines.	tikrit PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16888105" id="Pl-15" latLong="34.597°N 43.677°E" state="IQ-SD" type="PPL",baghdad PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-13" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC"
reporter: experts say saddam hussein's forces will likely try to hold out in baghdad for as long as possible without using the weapons his government insists it does not have, hoping to build international pressure on the u.s. and britain to back down. in that sense any use of chemical weapons would be counterproductive to saddam, because it would only galvanize international	baghdad PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-13" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC",u.s.

if we may again going to the wide screen of what appears to me to be abu dhabi television that is providing this picture, 3:20 a.m. in baghdad , live pictures again. that it is very difficult to discern whether or not that is, in point of fact, the missiles that we have become accustomed to striking baghdad and its environs , or whether it is the large 2,000 pound jdam bombs that have been striking targets sclected by the coalition in baghdad , or whether these flashes now represent artillery barrages as fighting continues to take control of the -- to take control of saddam international airport . again, correspondents, our correspondents with the -- embedded with these forces, with them in the field, saying in some cases they can see the lights of the skyline of baghdad . over the course of the past two weeks, since this war began, something like 23,000 coalition sorties have been flown, and over the course of the past 24 hours, 1,900 sorties flown. and we are told that, of those, 850 were strike sorties, motor vehicle most of those directed against the republican guard. as you know, the republican guard just outside baghdad to defend the city and saddam hussein's regime, in principal.	environs PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-85" state="IQ-BG" type="RGN",abu dhabi PLACE country="AE" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19217934" id="Pl-19" latLong="24.467°N 54.367°E" predicative="true" state="AE-AZ" type="PPLC",baghdad PLACE country="IQ" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-17" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC",city PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897821" id="Pl-25" latLong="30.494°N 47.819°E" mod="S" state="IQ-BA" type="PPL"
two of those divisions absolutely devastated, destroyed. the so-called medina division, and the baghdad division. the baghdad division, of course, getting its name from the fact that it is the republican guard division designated to defend principally baghdad . four other divisions we are told have also been hit very, very very hard and are principally trying to reinforce units va also been hit very hard.	medina PLACE country="SA" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897380" id="Pl-21" latLong="30.965°N 47.255°E" predicative="true" state="SA-03" type="PPLA",baghdad PLACE country="IQ" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-17" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC"
so we are seeing a lot of what some of the military officials are calling a method that does not seem to be directed by one person from the center of baghdad . and that raises questions, questions that have been in front of us since that first strike on march 19th against the location that the cia military intelligence thought was a place where saddam hussein, perhaps his sons, were. that preemptive strike they put, i think somewhat elegantly, trying to strike at the head of the snake. new explosions rocking parts of baghdad tonight.	baghdad PLACE country="IQ" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-17" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC"

Others, though, are novices.	
So what is it like for them to face combat far from home?	
For an idea, here is CNN's Candy Crowley with some war stories.	
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CANDY CROWLEY, CNN SR. POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over) They are, we are told, well trained.	
SEN. CHUCK HAGEL (R), NEBRASKA This is a messy business.	NEBRASKA PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780792" id="Pl-7" latLong="41.500°N 99.750°W" state="US-NE" type="CIVIL"
There's nothing very pretty about the training that you take to prepare you for combat, because it is to kill people.	
CROWLEY In the spring of 1970, a squad of U.S. soldiers spotted a small unit of Viet Cong that had been circling for days.	U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
Staff Sergeant Tom Ridge opened fire.	
A Viet Cong soldier dropped dead.	
(on camera): Did you at the time or have you since looked back and pondered on killing someone?	
TOM RIDGE, HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY Mm-hmm.	
CROWLEY And what's that like?	
RIDGE That's one of those introspective times where it's just -- it's just an introspective time, not a public time.	
CROWLEY (voice-over) Duke Cunningham was a Vietnam fighter ace shooting down five enemy planes.	Vietnam PLACE country="VN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16266660" id="Pl-12" latLong="16.167°N 107.833°E" type="COUNTRY"
After his first, he returned to a ship deck full of sailors and crew cheering, shaking his hand, pushing in to slap his back.	
REP. RANDY CUNNINGHAM (R), CALIFORNIA And one of the guys looked at me and says: Duke, what's it like to kill somebody?	CALIFORNIA PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780778" id="Pl-8" latLong="37.250°N 119.750°W" state="US-CA" type="CIVIL"
And, all of a sudden, bang, it just hit me.	
You don't think about those things.	
And it's removed.	
It's far off.	
It's not in close.	
And I went to the priest, because it bothered me.	
I knew I could do it again.	
But I didn't know it was going to bother me as much as it did.	
And it still does.	
CROWLEY Of all the wounds time does not heal, the ones that fester deep in the soul are the wounds you inflict.	
RIDGE It's not something that civilized people do.	
You don't -- it's just not -- it's not a matter of being tormented, but troubled in the sense that that's not what we do, unless we're called upon to do it, under the most extreme set of circumstances.	
CROWLEY War may sometimes be a necessary thing, but it can never be a natural thing.	
Training bridges that gap.	
Sergeant Chuck Hagel was seriously wounded twice in Vietnam .	Vietnam PLACE country="VN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16266660" id="Pl-12" latLong="16.167°N 107.833°E" type="COUNTRY"
HAGEL You are trying to kill people, because the alternative is, if you are in combat, you will be killed.	
So your choices are not varied.	
It's very simple.	
And so you do what you're trained to do.	
You do what you're there to do.	
And, in Vietnam , it was body count.	Vietnam PLACE country="VN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16266660" id="Pl-12" latLong="16.167°N 107.833°E" type="COUNTRY"
CROWLEY Training is what keeps you running toward the front while trucks loaded with dead bodies pass you, going the other way.	
REP. CHARLES RANGEL (D), NEW YORK It's hard to explain what training can do.	NEW YORK PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780796" id="Pl-9" latLong="43.000°N 75.500°W" state="US-NY" type="CIVIL"
Training sets your mind to respond not to common sense and judgment, but to training.	
You really don't have time to think: I'm going the wrong way.	
I should be going the other way.	
CROWLEY Later, when he was wounded and trapped behind enemy lines in Korea , Staff Sergeant Charlie Rangel led 40 men, fighting their way to safety.	Korea PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208826267" id="Pl-13" type="RGN"
He won a Bronze Star.	
RANGEL If you're killing people, it's out of fear, not really, in my opinion, out of bravery.	
Nobody is looking for medals.	
Everyone wants to live another day.	
CROWLEY Don't misunderstand.	
Rangel, Cunningham, Ridge and Hagel are all proud, decorated combat veterans.	
It's just, a decade later, killing still troubles the soul.	
Maybe that's a good thing. (on camera): Did you do it again?	
CUNNINGHAM I did.	
I shot down four more MiGs.	
And I often told myself -- I said that, if I ever get used to this, I shouldn't be here.

TUCHMAN (voice-over) As they get ready to head over hostile territory, 10 men aboard this Air Force HC-130 search and rescue and refueling plane start to feel their adrenaline rushing.

(on camera): Does your mindset change across the border into Iraq ?	Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-13" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
UNIDENTIFIED MALE No, because I am in an area which I don't know where the enemy could be and I might get to the airplane, by the time I get out of the airplane I'm thinking the same way.	
TUCHMAN Which is?	
UNIDENTIFIED MALE The hair on the back of my neck starts standing up, then something's going wrong.	
TUCHMAN (voice-over) As a precaution, the crew starts turning the huge plane in circles to see what the targets do.	
Ultimately it's discovered the targets are U.S. combat helicopters.	U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" type="COUNTRY"
Minutes later the search and rescue helicopter arrives for its refueling.	
Watch the flash from our night vision camera as the plane's fuel line connects with the chopper.	
Both aircraft fly at 125 miles per hour gingerly over enemy land.	
At times they are only 50 feet apart with the chopper's rotor blades getting closer.	
Looking with the naked eye out of the plane, the helicopter is impossible to see.	
The pitch-black maneuver ends after 10 minutes. (on camera): What stops though - we know the Iraqis have fired sand missiles and fired AAA at aircraft all throughout this war.	Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-13" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY",Iraqi PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-14" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
They haven't hit anybody, but isn't it risky flying so low knowing they have that ammunition to fire at you.	
UNIDENTIFIED MALE Again, we know where we're going.	
We know where they're at so we simply avoid them and if for some reason they do get off a lucky shot or they do see us, we have defensive systems on board the airplane to defeat their ammunition.	
TUCHMAN We all fly with bulletproof vests in case the plane goes down.	
We also fly with parachutes in case we need to get out before the plane goes down. (voice-over): But three airmen aboard this plane have parachutes for a different reason.	
They are the Pararescue jumpers, or PJs who jump off the plane for rescue missions.	
UNIDENTIFIED MALE I mean it's probably the most - the best feeling in the world knowing that your purpose is really defined at that moment.	
TUCHMAN No rescues were necessary on this sortie.

Hello Chris.	
CHRIS PLANTE, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT Hi, Judy.	
That's right.	
Four U.S. soldiers from the 3rd Infantry Division manning a checkpoint SIGNAL id="S-2" near SIGNAL the town of Najaf killed today in an apparent suicide bombing.	Najaf PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897127" id="Pl-21" latLong="31.992°N 44.351°E" state="IQ-NA" type="PPL",checkpoint PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-36" state="IQ-NA" type="FAC",U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-16" type="COUNTRY"
A man driving what appeared to be a taxicab came SIGNAL id="S-1" to SIGNAL the checkpoint , waved soldiers over, appeared to be having mechanical problems of some kind.	checkpoint PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-36" state="IQ-NA" type="FAC"
As the soldiers approached, the man detonated explosives in the car killing all four of the soldiers.	
This is something that Iraqi Vice President Ramadan had said would take place.	Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-13" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="S" type="COUNTRY",Iraqi PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-8" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
He said this long before the conflict ever began.	
He reiterated today in a press conference in Baghdad that this would just be the beginning of this that they would plan on killing thousands of U.S. troops with suicide bombing similar to this.	Baghdad PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-6" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC",U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-16" type="COUNTRY"
Also, in southern Iraq today near Basra , two members - claimed to be members of Saddam's Thataeen (ph) group surrendered to U.S. troops saying that they had been ordered to carry out suicide bombings down there but that they didn't want to die for the regime so they were surrendering.	Basra PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897821" id="Pl-14" latLong="30.494°N 47.819°E" state="IQ-BA" type="PPL",Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-13" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="S" type="COUNTRY",U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-16" type="COUNTRY"
At the Pentagon briefing today, General Stanley McChrystal said that it looked a lot like terrorism.	Pentagon PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1473192" id="Pl-37" latLong="38.871°N 77.056°W" state="US-VA" type="FAC"
MCCHRYSTAL It looks and feels like terrorism and what it requires is units to conduct forced production activities which they are prepared and do all the time but clearly when you see a tactic like this, it requires strict adherence or adjustments to your tactics, techniques and procedures to ensure that places like checkpoints are not vulnerable.	checkpoint PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-36" state="IQ-NA" type="FAC"
So it won't change our overall rules of engagement.	
It doesn't effect the operation at large but to protect our soldiers it clearly requires great care.	
PLANTE So certainly an unpleasant development today Judy and another item on the docket over here today is the failure of a number of cruise missiles.	
Tomahawk land detect missiles being from launched from ships in the eastern Mediterranean and in the Red Sea have suffered a number of failures.	
The Pentagon says a total of seven of the cruise missiles have failed crashing in Turkey and in Saudi Arabia .	Saudi Arabia PLACE country="SA" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16900879" id="Pl-25" latLong="25.000°N 45.000°E" type="COUNTRY",Turkey PLACE country="TR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19226169" id="Pl-24" latLong="39.000°N 35.000°E" type="COUNTRY",Pentagon PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1473192" id="Pl-37" latLong="38.871°N 77.056°W" state="US-VA" type="FAC"
No injuries reported.	
The missiles are programmed so that they don't detonate until they reach their target.	
If they go astray, then the warheads never arm but claiming that it's about one percent of the warheads.	
They've fired 675 or so tomahawk land detect missiles from ships and seven of those have failed.	
Judy ... WOODRUFF Chris, very quickly, new information from the Pentagon today about any concerns they have about Saddam Hussein's ongoing air defense capability?	Pentagon PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1473192" id="Pl-37" latLong="38.871°N 77.056°W" state="US-VA" type="FAC"
PLANTE Well, no major concern.	
The Pentagon says that they do have air dominance as they now call it over the vast majority of the country that there are certain areas and only certain areas of downtown Iraq where battle management radars linked to surface to air missiles are still in tact.	Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-13" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="S" type="COUNTRY",country PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-26" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY",Pentagon PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1473192" id="Pl-37" latLong="38.871°N 77.056°W" state="US-VA" type="FAC"
The reason that they're still in tact according to today's briefing was that they had not turned them on and as long as they don't turn them on, the U.S. has trouble locating them.	U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-16" type="COUNTRY"
They assure us that as soon as they do start turning on these radars that they'll take those out too and finish the job in terms of airspace over Baghdad .Judy ... WOODRUFF All right.

Ken Pollack, that resistance that we just saw the British troops dealing with, you and I were talking earlier today.	 ,British PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-28" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
The story the last few days has been the surprising level of resistance but you're telling me your sense is that the coalition forces are beginning to adjust to that.	 
KEN POLLACK, CENTER FOR MIDDLE EAST POLICY, BROOKINGS INSTITUTION Right.	 
I mean we're seeing one of the great advantages of U.S. and British forces now, Judy, which is that they're superbly trained troops.	 ,U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-24" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY",British PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-28" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
They have training in a whole variety of different missions and they're adapting.	 
They recognize now they went in with some false assumptions about the kind of reception that they were going to face.	 
The plan that was implemented had some inherent risks in it, risks to the supply line, risks in terms of not clearing cities and they're shifting.	 
They're changing and the troops are trained well enough to be able to deal with that.	 
You've seen U.S. Central Command bringing up additional forces like the 82nd Airborne Division to better deal with these long supply lines, get control over the cities and so I think that U.S. and British forces are beginning to stabilize the battlefield.	 ,U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-24" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY",British PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-28" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
WOODRUFF So as an onlooker, as somebody who's studied the Iraqi capabilities, is it your sense that the coalition can continue to adjust to whatever they deal with?	 ,Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-10" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY",Iraqi PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-13" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
POLLACK Absolutely.	 
One of the things I think we're likely to see is that the Iraqis are going to have a tougher time adapting than U.S. forces are.	 ,U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-24" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY",Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-10" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY",Iraqi PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-13" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
Typically what you've seen in the Iraqi armed forces is the change has to come from the top.	 ,Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-10" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY",Iraqi PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-13" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
It doesn't come from the ground up.	 
You don't have ground commanders calling back and saying hey, we'd like to try this tactic or this seems to work.	 
Tell everybody else to do the same thing.	 
Instead the high command has to identify a problem, come up with a solution and transmit it down.	 
Chances are the Iraqis are going to continue to stick with what we've seen before, irregular forces blending in with civilians trying to attack U.S. forces, some more of these suicide attacks which are going to be problematic for our troops.	 ,U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-24" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY",Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-10" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY",Iraqi PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-13" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
There's no way around that but U.S. forces, British forces are beginning to adapt to it.	 ,U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-24" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY",British PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-28" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"

They hate Saddam Hussein.	 
They don't like what he's doing but they don't think the Americans are the answer.	 
POLLACK All right.	 
Well, this is something that we've been trying to get a grip on for years, exactly what the Iraqi people feel and also that I think the best evidence that we had before the attack began was that Iraqis do, they despise.	 ,Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-10" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY",Iraqi PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-13" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
They are desperate to be rid of him but by the same token, they don't like another country coming into their country to overturn the government and beyond that, I think it's probably most important for most Iraqis is they're deeply suspicious of the United States .

WOODRUFF Which raises questions going forward.	 
One last thing, Ken Pollack I want to ask about this British officials saying that they have information that Saddam Hussein has fired his air defense chief.	 ,British PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-28" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
What's the significance of that?	 
POLLACK Well, if it's true and obviously we don't know just yet but if it's true, it is very significant because it's effectively the Iraqis admitting that many of the civilian casualties that we've seen over the last few days may in fact have been caused by Iraqi surface to air missiles falling back to ground in residential areas.	 ,Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-10" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY",Iraqi PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-13" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
WOODRUFF (INAUDIBLE) POLLACK Exactly, in that market and I think it was pretty apparent when you looked at the video of that market , if that had been a U.S. bomb or a U.S. cruise missile, that market would have been obliterated.	 ,market PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-77" type="FAC",U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-24" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"

Judy ... WOODRUFF Ben, what is your best understanding of what it is on the ground that the coalition forces are going after there?	
WEDEMAN Well, basically on the ridge itself it is the most forward Iraqi army positions and we've been watching them very closely for the last month prior to the war to the outbreak of the war and basically these are the positions that control this entire valley . Up there they have heavy machine guns.	valley PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-23" state="IQ-TS" type="RGN",Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-8" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="N" type="COUNTRY",Iraqi PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-7" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY",ridge PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-22" state="IQ-TS" type="MTS"
They have mortars.	
They have anti-tank guns, hundreds of men along this very long ridge that basically runs from the north to the south.	ridge PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-22" state="IQ-TS" type="MTS"
In addition to that, we know that further back behind those lines in the direction of Mosul there is heavy artillery and tanks as well, this according to the people here in this area, the local Kurds who have been going across the lines for many years basically engaged in smuggling.	area PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-13" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="N" type="COUNTRY",Mosul PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897344" id="Pl-12" latLong="36.335°N 43.119°E" state="IQ-NI" type="PPLA"

Of course this is the home of the anti- war demonstrations stemming back to the Vietnam War but there are close to between 500 and 1,000 people.	Vietnam PLACE country="VN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16266660" id="Pl-35" latLong="16.167°N 107.833°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
I'm getting various estimates on the crowd.	
We did want to show you an interesting thing here.	
Some folks are showing some solidarity with the speakers here.	
You're looking at some of San Francisco 's police department's officers.	San Francisco PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:278593" id="Pl-31" latLong="37.775°N 122.418°W" state="US-CA" type="PPL"
I did ask them why they did that.	
They said they were wearing skullcaps so they decided to adopt this to show solidarity.	
They said the department has not made any statement about whether they think that's all right or not.	
This has been a very peaceful demonstration.	
As I said, the officers did tell me that this is the largest pro-troops demonstration that has ever been in San Francisco since the Vietnam War.

So far, very peaceful.	
As I said, there have been a few verbal exchanges but one of the most enthusiastically received speakers here was Bessam Al-Husaini, an Iraqi American.

DORNIN How do you feel though seeing pictures of civilians injured in the bombings?	
AL-HUSAINI We get reports that these civilians especially in the (INAUDIBLE) population have been attacked by the Iraqi regime themselves so they can't blame the American and said look what the American doing to us.

You know they stay in one room .	
They boarded all the - all the windows and they built with a brick one of the windows facing the street .

DORNIN Now I understand some of the people here have been threatened by anti-war protesters.	
Have you had anyone either threatening you or ... AL-HUSAINI No, no problem.	
This has been a very peaceful demonstration.	
DORNIN OK.	
Thank you very much.	
AL-HUSAINI Thank you.	
DORNIN Bessam Al-Husaini here and it has been a very peaceful demonstration.

This one took a bulldozer to a concrete portrait of Saddam Hussein.	
It took about 20 minutes but finally it came toppling down.	
He says after finishing the job he hopes Saddam Hussein himself will fall too but despite the exuberance of Kurds in the area, it's clear it's much too early to celebrate.	
Although the Iraqis retreated from this area, at dusk they fired what observers say were seven artillery rounds back at their former stronghold creating new fear and potentially new casualties.

How has this been for you?	
KAYCEE MARTIN, WIFE OF SOLDIER It's been difficult.	
It's hard without him.	
I'm doing OK but it would be much better if he was home with me.	
COOPER If I could just ask, I mean and you know I don't want to pry so anytime I ask something you don't want to say just tell me to shut up but what is it like for you watching all this coverage?	
I mean watching, you know, the access.	
The pictures were seeing are really historic in what we are able to see.	
Is it more - does it make it more difficult?	
Does it make it easier?	
K. MARTIN It's very difficult.	
It's hard.	
The whole time though you're just sitting there trying to catch a glimpse just to see if maybe one of the people on TV is him but you know he tells me don't watch, don't watch.	
You know, it's going to be difficult but like I said, it's just too hard.	
I want to be able to see just to make sure that he's OK, just catch a glimpse of him.	
COOPER How does he look to you right now?	
K. MARTIN He looks all right, but dirty.	
SGT. CRAIG MARTIN, 15TH MARINE EXPEDITIONARY UNIT I lost my tooth.	
K. MARTIN Beautiful.	
Thanks.	
Thanks for showing me.	
COOPER How'd you - how'd you lose your tooth?	
C. MARTIN Sorry.	
COOPER Can I ask?	
How did you lose your tooth?	
C. MARTIN When we came across the bridge, the enemy launched some 155 artillery rounds at us.	
It came pretty close and the concussion knocked my tooth out.	
K. MARTIN Great.	
C. MARTIN Yes.	
K. MARTIN It doesn't sound like you're being too careful.	
C. MARTIN It was fun though.	
We're all right.	
COOPER Sergeant Martin I don't know if you see, your wife's sort of shaking her head.	
C. MARTIN Careful as I can be.	
It's all good.	
COOPER Sergeant Martin, is there anything else ... C. MARTIN I love you.	
COOPER Is there anything else you would like to say either to your wife or to all the people who are watching this?	
I know this awkward, you know, doing this on TV and I hate to put you in this position but feel free.	
C. MARTIN Yeah.	
I've got a couple of things real quick.	
To my old man, this is not a distraction.	
To my wife, we'll be home soon and I love you.	
That's all I've got to say.	
COOPER Well that says a lot.	
Kaycee, anything else you want to say?	
K. MARTIN I love you very much.	
I miss you very much.	
Everyone is praying for you and I just want you to come home safe and soon so you could see our new baby.	
C. MARTIN One more thing, you look really beautiful right now. K. MARTIN Thanks.	
I'd like to say the same to you.	
C. MARTIN That's stylish.	
Don't worry.	
We'll take it home.	
K. MARTIN Well, just come home soon.	
C. MARTIN Without a doubt.	
K. MARTIN --- Well, just come home soon.	
C. MARTIN I'll try baby.

It was the Army which assigned me to the 3rd Squadron, 7th Cavalry, and that was extremely fortuitous.

Seventy-two hours of that was under constant fire coming at us from both sides of the road . UNIDENTIFIED MALE We just heard an incoming -- what the hell!	
UNIDENTIFIED MALE No, no, I don't know what it is.	
RODGERS Recall Winston Churchill's old quote, "There's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at and missed."	
What you try to do is stay calm and continue your broadcasting.	
The worst thing you can do, either as a soldier or as a war correspondent is panic.	
We're hearing incoming.	
We're not sure what it is.	
We see some stuff in the sky.	
We may have to break this off.	
I think we're going to break off this live shot for the time being.	
We're not sure what we see up there.	
Goodbye.	
We've got to dive for vehicles, we think.	
See you.	
Bye.	
We have under heavy fire for the past couple of miles.	
Mostly small arms fire, but the sand storm has enabled the Iraqis to come very close to the road , and if I sound a little nervous, it's because we're in the soft skin vehicle and everybody else is in armor.

This is what we've literally been living in.	
This is the kitchen, when we're down, and we're very fortunate, because we've got a teapot.	
That's my cubby hole.	
It's extraordinary cramped, because (UNINTELLIGIBLE) sandbag the floor, in case we hit a mine.	
That's all the space I have to eat and sleep in.	
You don't sleep.	
You really don't sleep out here.	
Of course, you're on an adrenaline high, but racing across the desert, you know that you're traveling toward the jaws of what could be a major military battle.	
You have to realize, they've been riding along, bouncing along in these tanks for probably six or more hours now.	
And if you ride inside that tank, it is like riding in the bowels of a dragon.	
They roar, they screech.	
The hardest part of the trip is personal discomfort.	
We cannot tell you the levels of personal discomfort we've experienced.	
The extraordinary sandstorms, the bitter cold nights.	
The most uncomfortable thing is having to sleep sitting up in a Humvee with sandbags under your feet, your knees at your chin.	
That's excruciatingly uncomfortable, not something that you would wish on anybody but a contortionist.	
Let me give you an example of what the dust like.	
Look at this.	
We have been through days of dust like that.	
The U.S. Army's 7th Cavalry has just taken three Iraqi prisoners of war.

Actually, they're very close, that is to say, no more than 40 yards away, but the dust and sand are blowing so badly you're getting these vague images.	
It's like being in a blizzard, except unfortunately, the sand doesn't melt as the snow does.	
What we eat is what the Army calls MREs, meals ready to eat.	
And I must say, they're pretty darn good.	
And of course, everybody fights for the best ones.	
The treats are things like the M&amp;Ms and the breakfast toasties.	
The Army is eating much, much better than the grandfathers of these soldiers did and the great grandfathers of these soldiers in the Second World War.	
Let me hold the camera and show you my crew.	
On camera left is Charlie Miller (ph), he's been our superb and intrepid cameraman.	
On my right is Jeff Barweis (ph), a brilliant satellite engineer.	
That's the crew which really brings you these pictures.	
The pictures you're seeing are absolutely phenomenal.	
These are live pictures of the 7th Cavalry racing across the desert.	
You've never seen battlefield pictures like these before.

JAMIE MCINTYRE, CNN SNR.	
MILITARY AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT Well Judy, the Pentagon is beginning to see positive signs that it hadn't seen for awhile.	Pentagon PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1473192" id="Pl-35" latLong="38.871°N 77.056°W" state="VA" type="FAC"
First of all, as we saw just a few moments ago on CNN, the pictures of some of the actual happy Iraqi citizens welcoming U.S. troops, that taking place in Najaf .

Also the Pentagon is seeing lighter than expected resistance indicating at least that they may have really seriously degraded those Republican Guard divisions before the U.S. troops arrived, both in Karbala and also in Al Kut .

They met lighter than expected resistance.	
But the Pentagon officials stress that as they close in on Baghdad , this becomes the real dangerous part as they enter that so- called red zone where Saddam Hussein is believed to have given his commanders authority to use chemical weapons, and that use of chemical weapons remains a real fear at the Pentagon .

So, in regard to that, we are paying great attention to their ability to defend on the ground.	
They may just suddenly be effective on the ground.	
Additionally, their ability to use chemical and biological weapons, they've proven it historically.	
We believe they have the capability now.	
Clearly, as we threaten the core of the regime, which Baghdad and Tikrit represent, we believe that the likelihood of them using those weapons goes up.

Judy.	
WOODRUFF Jamie, these descriptions of the weakening of the Republican Guard begin to bring back memories of the first Gulf War 12 years ago.	
Is there a chance that coalition forces could, at this point, be overestimating the strength of what's left of the opposition?	
MCINTYRE Well, they might be.	
And that might be a good thing.	
They are taking it very cautiously.	
No one, again, they stress the most dangerous part of this could be ahead.	
Could be urban combat.	
Could involve chemical weapons.	
Could be the most loyal fighters left as they draw into Baghdad .	Baghdad PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-19" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC"
Could be a very dangerous time.	
They also are careful to point out that even while they say that the division has been destroyed, they don't mean every single person has been killed.	
Simply that its combat effectiveness has been eliminated - Judy.	
WOODRUFF We notice they said they did not want to use the word destroyed, in fact, they said let others do that.

For a look at what might lie ahead for U.S. forces, let's turn to our Miles O'Brien in Atlanta .

MILES O'BRIEN, CNN ANCHOR Thank you very much, Judy.	
To help guide us through all this discussion about red zones, and daggers and exactly what is the strength of the Republican Guard, we turn to Colonel Patrick Lang.	
He's retired with the United States Army.	United States PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-9" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
He spent some time in the Defence Intelligence Agency, among other things.	
Colonel, good to have you with us.	
COL. PAT LANG (RET,), U.S. ARMY You're welcome.	U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-6" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
O'BRIEN What do you suppose right now would be the governor on the forward advance?	
Is it the Republican Guard or is it the U.S. and coalition supply lines?	U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-6" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
Or both?	
LANG Well, they are close enough up to Baghdad now so that the supply line issue is probably not a big one since they had time to restock, food, fuel and ammunition.	Baghdad PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-19" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC"
So, probably the main thing is combing through the rubble that the air force has left of these Republican Guard divisions to make sure there are no strong points that you leave behind, that could threaten your lines of supply once they get past.	
Once they are satisfied they are through all that, I would imaging there will be a pause while they start to reconnoiter into Baghdad , probing hard to see how much resistance there really is.	Baghdad PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-19" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC"
O'BRIEN Well, let me ask you that.	
First of all, I just wanted to tell viewers where we just took our satellite imagery.	
This is that Karbala area which is SIGNAL id="S-1" about 50 miles SIGNAL from Baghdad .	Baghdad PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-19" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC",Karbala PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16892923" id="Pl-20" latLong="32.250°N 43.117°E" state="IQ-KA" type="RGN"
Baghdad is roughly in that direction from there.	Baghdad PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-19" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC"
We know the vanguard is supposedly as close as 15 miles.	
One of the next key points along the way here is Saddam international airport . Do you suppose that is a key target right now?	Saddam international airport PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" id="Pl-274" type="FAC"
LANG Oh, I'm sure it is.	
I mean a feature of that importance would always be something you'd want to hold.	
And besides, as soon as you get control of it you'd be able to start using it for air operations, and put a survey team in there as soon as it's secured, and then start using it for helicopter operations, haul forward some big bladders of fuel to refuel helicopters and rearm them and things like that.	
And if the front stabilizes between there and the downtown Baghdad , they'll start using it for a fixed wing aircraft as well.	Baghdad PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-19" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC"
O'BRIEN Now, as you go from Saddam International Airport into town you see there are some big, wide divided highways there.	Saddam International Airport PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" id="Pl-285" type="FAC"
Control of these highways will be crucial won't it?	
LANG Yeah, these are the high-speed approaches into the heart of the city and armored forces like the 3rd Mechanized Infantry Division just love high-speed approaches.	city PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-28" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC"
They will try to go down those things, cutting the city up into sectors as best they can, and then work on the specific sectors of the city they think are a key terrain.	city PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-28" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC"
I would think, probably, various facilities as well as major government buildings that they need to control to set up a new government.	
O'BRIEN It's a big city , about the size of Philadelphia or thereabouts.	Philadelphia PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1210052" id="Pl-29" latLong="39.952°N 75.164°W" state="US-PA" type="PPL",city PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-28" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC"
Some have said Chicago is a good analogy.	Chicago PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:424587" id="Pl-30" latLong="41.850°N 87.650°W" state="US-IL" type="PPL"
Tremendous amount of force needed to control a city of that source, or am a wrong?	city PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-28" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC"
LANG Well, it depends on the attitude of the populous, which is not clear yet.	
If the population, in fact, or at least a big part of them like the Shia half of the population, if they want to be liberated, then you can control them with a fairly small force.	
If, in fact, a lot of people in the city don't want to be liberated and you're never going to know that until you try, then you're going to need a much larger force, and we might end up waiting a couple of weeks for reinforcements.	city PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-28" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC"
O'BRIEN Based on what you've seen so far, what is your sense of that?	
The Shias are a bit gun shy, if you will, in the south because of what happened in 1991.	
They rose up, didn't get American support.	American PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-7" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
Do you suppose it will be a different story in Baghdad ?	Baghdad PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-19" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC"
Is there a lot of latent hatred for Saddam Hussein that will come out?	
LANG Yes, there is, but these folks are going to be mighty cautious.	
They have a long history of being kicked around by the Sunni Arab population of central Iraq .	Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
And they don't have any particular reason to trust us, so far.	
So they'll wait and see what happens.	
It's the other people in the city you have to worry about, who are ethnically much the same as the Saddam Hussein regime.	city PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-28" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC"
And their behavior right now is unpredictable.

GARY TUCHMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT Well, that's right, Judy.	
In two weeks after the air war began, there is no let-up and no effective response from the Iraqis.

What's happen is the military personnel who have arrived here have taken out their markers and are writing messages on Saddam Hussein's portrait.	
You can see the main one here on the bottom and also here messages like, we won, April 1, 2003.	
Want to give you a look.	
There's a lot of security personnel here.	
You can look over there and you can see the military vehicles.	
These are Air Force Security Forces with their rifles patrolling the entrance.	
There is a lot of fighting in this area.	
We're near the town of Nasiriya .	Nasiriya PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897120" id="Pl-17" latLong="31.054°N 46.259°E" state="IQ-DQ" type="PPLA"
But this base now is considered secure enough to make it a major staging point for the coalition.	base PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-345" type="FAC"
(END VIDEOTAPE) TUCHMAN A short time ago we talked to a pilot at this base who has been to that Iraqi base and he too says he has signed that mural right on Saddam Hussein's sash.	base PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-345" type="FAC",Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-10" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY",Iraqi PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-9" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
After he told us that, we asked him during his missions, and he's flown about 30 in the last two weeks, we asked him does he still have any artillery being fired at him?

So they're still out there.	
But the air power and the air package that we take to the fight, we continue to be effective.	
And we attrit the Medina forces down to less than 50 percent.	Medina PLACE country="SA" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897380" id="Pl-18" latLong="30.965°N 47.255°E" predicative="true" state="SA-03" type="PPL"
And when we put our power punch to them and then the Army and the Marines move forward it's a very effective, coordinated effort.	
(END VIDEO CLIP) TUCHMAN Lieutenant Colonel Webb (ph) is telling us he has a mission this very evening.	
We want to tell you the Air Force has just informed us that between this morning and tomorrow morning, it will fly 1,900 sorties into Iraq .	Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-10" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
A total over the last two weeks now of close to 24,000 sorties.	
Before we go, one more thing we want to tell you about, superstitions.	
Military people are very superstitious, like many of us are.	
Here at this particular base they get their MREs, their MREs are their Meals Ready to Eat.	base PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-345" type="FAC"
They come in a bag.	
And when you get an MRE you get your meal and you get a little treat with it.	
What a lot of people here at this base do, when their treat happens to be this one, this is the candy called Charms, many of the people refuse to eat their Charms.	base PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-345" type="FAC"
They consider it a good luck charm to keep their Charms in their clothes and not to eat them.	
So one little superstitious tale for you, Judy.	
Back to you.	
WOODRUFF Well, I'm one of those who thinks that we need to pay attention to our superstitions.	
Gary, one another quick question for you.	
That air base that coalition forces have now taken control of near Nasiriya .	Nasiriya PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897120" id="Pl-17" latLong="31.054°N 46.259°E" state="IQ-DQ" type="PPLA",base PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-345" type="FAC"
Are you able to say, are they actually using it or getting much use out of it?	
TUCHMAN What they are doing, Judy, some of these A-10s behind me go there to refuel, to stage operations further north.	
They also fly these HH-60 helicopters, they're the search and rescue helicopters used in case they have to search and find somebody on the ground.	
They stage there and refuel.	
But right now, none of them are permanently based there, although the plan is for that to eventually happen.	base PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-345" type="FAC"
WOODRUFF All right, Gary Tuchman with some Charms.	
You saw him holding it.

We don't think that the fighting is over yet, and so there are still options available to the regime, including the use of weapons of mass destruction.

And at the same time, we remain prepared to continue operations.	
DINNON The Americans say they've destroyed two divisions of the elite Republican Guard. (on camera): The Medina division, which is one of the toughest outfits in the Republican Guard is now down to 10 percent of its fighting strength.

They're walking toward the press.	
Let's listen.	
GREG LYNCH SR., JESSICA LYNCH'S FATHER Good afternoon.	
We appreciate y'all coming out for what you're doing for Jessie and all of the other troops that are missing.	
We've been waiting all day word from the doctors, and they have successively done one surgery on her.	
There will be other surgeries to do that.	
It's going to take time and patience.	
DEE LYNCH, JESSICA'S MOTHER But she's great and she's doing good.	
G. LYNCH She's in real good spirits.	
We talked to her.	
D. LYNCH We talked to her before the surgery, we talked to her after the surgery, and she's doing good.	
Can't you think?	
G. LYNCH Yes, a bunch, but my mind's blank.	
The doctor has completed one surgery on her back.	
They have released the pressure on a nerve, and realigned all the disks and put plates and stuff in it, and that was because she didn't have any feeling in her feet.	
So he, he's pretty sure right now that that will relieve, relieve the tension, and her feet will be able to move.	
Also, we have heard and seen reports that she had multiple gunshot wounds, and knife stabbing.	
The doctor has not seen any of this.	
He looked for the gunshot wounds for the knife stabbing, and there is no injury whatsoever.	
They will do surgery again tomorrow on her legs.	
She has fractured legs and her right forearm.	
And we are just waiting to get that good news too.	
D. LYNCH We talked to her before and after the surgery, like I said, and she's just, she just sounded real good.	
Of course, this morning she was a little groggy.	
But yet, she was good, because it was early.	
And then this afternoon, after the surgery, she was our Jessie again.	
QUESTION If those weren't gunshot wounds to cause the broken bones, do they know what caused the fractures?	
G. LYNCH They have no idea at this time what caused them.	
We know she's in good spirits, because they told her they was gonna put pink casts on her legs and arms, and she had pink casts when she was in the third grade on her arm so we know she -- her mind is working good.	
So she's in good spirits, and we hope the surgery will go good tomorrow, just as well as it did today.	
QUESTION Can you tell us what she said to you on the telephone?	
You said she was in good spirits?	
Can you describe your conversation?	
G. LYNCH I teased her again about the Army jeeps and she said, "I know where there's a bunch of that we can find."	
So, we know she's in good spirits.	
D. LYNCH She was asking for a hairbrush.	
WOODRUFF Gregory Lynch, the father of Jessica Lynch, and Jessica's mother talking to reporters, saying they have talked to her today, both before and after surgery, that she says she's feeling good.	
They say she will be good.	
But they said the doctors did go in and apparently do some work on her spinal cord or spinal column.	
He said to relieve some pressure on a nerve.	
They were concerned because she didn't have feeling in her feet.	
They did go on to say the doctors could not find either bullet or knife entry wounds, suggesting that her broken bones came from some other source, and it is not clear yet.	
Her parents said they don't know yet what caused their daughter's injuries.

 Iraqis Mistakenly Believe Soldiers Have Sights on Sacred Landmark	
Thanks very much, Judy.	
And Colonel Leonhard, we're going to talk a little bit about urban combat.	
And I wanted to just start this off by saying a lot of people when they hear about urban combat, they think of that Blackhawk down scenario, Mogadishu and the problems that can go wrong here.	Mogadishu PLACE country="SO" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16772563" id="Pl-6" latLong="2.067°N 45.367°E" predicative="true" state="SO-BN" type="PPLC"
This is not probably a comparable situation, is it?	
LT. COL. ROBERT LEONHARD, U.S. ARMY (RET.	U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
) Not in any way.	
And one of the reasons is because we have armored fighting vehicles there in Baghdad , and we will use them.	Baghdad PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC"
Those tanks have 120-millimeter smoothbore gun on them.	
The Bradleys have 25-millimetre chain guns and coaxial machine guns.	
That's a lot of mobile protective gunfire.	
Completely different from the Mogadishu situation in which we did not have such vehicles.	Mogadishu PLACE country="SO" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16772563" id="Pl-6" latLong="2.067°N 45.367°E" predicative="true" state="SO-BN" type="PPLC"
And we also are not going to use similar tactics there.	
We are much more likely to use patience and finesse rather than assault tactics.	
O'BRIEN All right.	
We want to show you an animation, and share with our viewers, maybe you can point out a few things about this.	
If we move in on Baghdad , and give you a sense of the kinds of targets that might be encountered in urban combat.	Baghdad PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC"
What we've depicted here is something here which shows some armor sort of off the wings here, right over here is a mosque .	mosque PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-234" state="IQ-BG" type="FAC"
We depict that to show that's something you obviously want to stay clear as we just saw with the Ryan Chilcote piece from Najaf .	Najaf PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897127" id="Pl-7" latLong="31.992°N 44.351°E" state="IQ-NA" type="PPLA"
As we get a little bit closer here, in a typical scenario like this, you might very well have Republican Guard snipers up on balconies like this, and possibly up on the roofs of buildings and anti-aircraft artillery or artillery encampments like that.	
What we have presented her is an armored column with air support coming in.	
How much jeopardy is a column like this in as it goes through these concrete canyons in a city?	
LEONHARD It's a great question.	
I think the animation is good because it does show that you can hide literally anywhere in a city environment, and that is why movement through an urban area is very, very dangerous.	
It's the side that's moving that's going to take the casualties.	
That said, the armored fighting vehicles that you see there they look to me as if they're moving a little bit faster as than we probably will.	
We'll use patience and finesse.	
We will take the time to locate the enemy, surround the blocks and the buildings that he is in.	
And then we'll probably surge fires into their both lethal and nonlethal to make his position untenable, to make him move rather than us moving through the assault zone.	
At which time we can engage them or arrest them.	
O'BRIEN We'd like to resume with that animation if we could.	
That's Saddam International Airport .	Saddam International Airport PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" id="Pl-231" state="IQ-BG" type="FAC"
That's another segment.	
Can we get back to the animation.	
And I'd like to just finish this out.	
Here we go.	
Ad we move it along, you'll see eventually the troops will come marching in.	
In this case, slightly off target here because you see them all going in the front door.	
Typically, when they'd assault a target like this, they'd do what?	
LEONHARD Well, typically, if they do go in, which is generally the option of last resort, but if we do have to go in, often we'll try to go in from the top of the building down.	
One of the reasons is because we use grenades a lot in clearing buildings, and grenades ten to offend downhill rather than uphill.	
So, you always want them going down staircases rather than having to try to throw them up the staircase.	
O'BRIEN Interesting, all right.	
Gravity rules, even in urban combat.	
Lieutenant Colonel Robert Leonard, we appreciate your insights in urban combat, something that is not something that the U.S. military would prefer to engage in, but it might become inevitable.	U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"

(END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTSON Now, representatives of the committee -- the International Committee for the Red Cross, who have been to some of the hospitals in Baghdad , report higher-than-usual numbers of casualties coming into those hospitals.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROLAND NUGUENIN-BENJAMIN, INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF THE RED CROSS (on phone) We had a chance in the morning to go to the main hospital, which is called Yarmuk (ph), and we found there has been a steady flow in of hundreds of casualties, all over the night and through into the day, casualties -- I mean, war wounded had to be sent over, dispatched to other hospitals, because this Yarmuk was just totally overwhelmed by the sheer number of people coming in.	
(END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTSON Now, these Red Cross representatives say that most -- that two-thirds of the casualties they've seen in this particular hospital are, in fact, military casualties.	
And Iraqi officials promise to take journalists to this particular hospital, the Yarmuk Hospital, that is now located, it's on the southwest of Baghdad , and it appears to be pretty much between the position of where coalition forces have been seen and where Iraq now has a militarized front-line position.

Now, when journalists were taken to see that hospital, twice they were turned around and told that they weren't actually allowed to go inside that hospital, Judy.	
WOODRUFF Nic, when you say Iraqis are seen now putting artillery pieces out and around the city , are you saying out in the open, where they can -- where they are vulnerable, or are they making any attempt to hide them?

Give us clearer picture of that.	
ROBERTSON One of the areas where I understand they're locating tanks and artillery pieces is the Zawara (ph) Park.	
This is fairly central in Baghdad on the edge of a government area.	Baghdad PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-23" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC"

It faces off against the highway that leads out to the airport.	
Now, that is not in a residential area.	
It is a clear, open area, apart from trees.	
The other areas that we understand where Iraqi officials are placing tanks and blocking off streets are in more residential areas, Judy.

Hello again, Miles.	
O'BRIEN Hello again, Judy.	
I'm joined by J. Kelly McCann, our security analyst, a man who's spent a lot of time learning about urban combat.	
You know, just those two words together, I think, scare a lot of people because of all the things that can go wrong.	
You know, I'm impressed, looking at this map, it almost looks like a chess game, kind of sterile.	
That is -- couldn't be further from the truth, could it?	
J. KELLY MCCANN, CNN SECURITY ANALYST Absolutely not.	
This is very clean and it's very orderly.	
Suddenly when we show the videotape and we start to go there, you'll see just how conflicted an environment that is.	
O'BRIEN And all happening so quickly.	
MCCANN (UNINTELLIGIBLE).	
O'BRIEN Let's roll some tape.	
We're going to kind of play it and stop it, and Kelly's going to walk us through, I guess, Urban Combat 101.	
What are we seeing here?	
MCCANN Just there, I mean, just getting the door out of the way, you can see where the weapons have to go.	
Now, you just see this soldier right here, he's going to his sidearm to make a little bit more mobile.	
And he's got to be careful of his muzzle pointing at his partner right here.	
Now, he's going to go that direction, because that room is clear.	room PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-227" state="US-BG" type="FAC"
Go ahead and stop the tape.As you make every entry, Miles, there are two dead spots, one, of course, in this direction right here, which you can't see from the doorway, the other in this direction right here, and that's always the problem, because as you come in here, you've got to be able to get in there quickly and make sure that this person here doesn't get shot in the back.	
So... O'BRIEN All right.	
Now, what about this, this armor?	
Tell us how they're equipped with armor there.	
MCCANN Level 4 armor, this is not just for frag.	
This will also stop bullets.	
And there's a difference.	
The normal flak jacket will stop fragments from grenades, et cetera.	
This is a plate that will actually stop and deform a bullet.	
O'BRIEN All right.	
Let's roll tape and continue on here and talk about -- Now, I notice his hand -- his sidearm is attached to him.	
That's for.	
.. for..	
. for...	
MCCANN Exactly..

So he goes down the hallway , and you can see once that's called clear, straight trigger finger, in case there's any sympathetic muscle tightening, there's no problem.	hallway PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-233" state="US-BG" type="FAC"
You'll see another person come right up here, and he'll hold on this door, because that's not been cleared space yet, again, straight trigger finger, but ready to shoot if he needs to.	
O'BRIEN Sort of ready but not quite (UNINTELLIGIBLE).	
MCCANN Absolutely.	
O'BRIEN (UNINTELLIGIBLE).	
MCCANN Immediately making entry with the thing, and then pying (ph) the room out, getting angles of vision as they clear it.	room PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-227" state="US-BG" type="FAC"
But look at that, a dark space from a lighted space.	
Who knows what's in the recesses?	
O'BRIEN All right.	
Let's roll that second tape quickly, and we'll show you a couple more tips from Kelly's perspective.	
So far, what we're seeing is pretty much textbook.	
MCCANN Absolutely. (UNINTELLIGIBLE)..	
. (UNINTELLIGIBLE)...	
O'BRIEN All right.	
Now, this is a rural setting, but this could be applied to urban combat, yes.	
MCCANN Very different circumstance.	
Same thing when you come into a building.	
But stop the tape right here..	
. here...	
O'BRIEN Oop, we missed it, we missed it.	
.. it..

MCCANN ... if you would, (UNINTELLIGIBLE) -- It's all right.	
You can see all this area.	area PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-231" state="US-BG" type="RGN"

O'BRIEN No, just roll it.	
MCCANN ... out here.	
Just go ahead and roll it.	
All of that has to be accounted for as well, not just the space in here.	
Your back is not covered.	
Many angles you've got to watch for.	
Now, you see right here, he's got a sidearm, he's calling the team in.	
All the rear is -- Now, stop the tape.	
O'BRIEN Yes, (UNINTELLIGIBLE).	
MCCANN Imagine a person that is concealed anywhere in here.	
I mean, you could have anyone with a rifle back in these areas here.	area PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-231" state="US-BG" type="RGN"
.. here..

O'BRIEN Up in this area here, here.	area PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-231" state="US-BG" type="RGN"
.. here..	
. here...	
MCCANN ... in any of these recesses back over here.	
O'BRIEN Oop.	
MCCANN I mean, you know, you're looking at -- he wouldn't have a bomb (UNINTELLIGIBLE).	
.. (UNINTELLIGIBLE)..	
. (UNINTELLIGIBLE)...	
O'BRIEN No, he wouldn't have that.	
But let me ask you this.	
Also that the garb, (UNINTELLIGIBLE) there's a cultural issue here.	
That provides a lot of cover for weapons if need be, right?	
MCCANN Absolutely.	
And someones might say, Well, why put their hands on their head like this?	
Because, you know, you -- the hands hurt.	
And I won't be able to determine what you're doing with your face.	
Where are your hands and what do they hold?	
O'BRIEN All right.	
Let's roll it real quickly and we'll make a few more points, if we could.	
A lot of fear in their faces here.	
You see, by the way, they all have radios, I notice they have, like, a little headset there.	
That allows them to communicate (UNINTELLIGIBLE).	
.. (UNINTELLIGIBLE)..	
. (UNINTELLIGIBLE)...

The evidence suggested it was the scene of appalling atrocities.	 
The teeth in many of the skulls had been broken, and bones appeared to be wrapped in strips of military uniform.	 
It's not clear how long the bodies had lain here, but they were clearly not from this war.	 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE You come to expect everything in war fighting.	 
The coffins were there.	 
It was a bit more of a surprise when I discovered the bags with the human remains inside.	 
EWART Inside a neighboring building , there was evidence of cells and a catalog of photographs of the dead.	 
Most had died from gunshot wounds to the head.	 
Others were mutilated beyond recognition, their faces burned and swollen.	 
Outside, soldiers discovered what they described as a purpose- built shooting gallery , the brickwork behind it riddled with bullets.	 
Identity cards revealed the names of some of the dead.	 
Forensic specialists will now visit the scene and hope to establish the truth of what happened here and when.	 
(on camera): Today's discovery seems to provide shocking evidence of atrocities under Saddam Hussein's regime.	 
Most people are afraid to talk openly about what's been happening here.	 
But when they do, British soldiers believe, more horrors will come to light.	 ,British PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-9" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"

Down we went, further to cells that had no light, little air, cockroaches, filth, and, on the ground, a gas mask and bottles of chemicals.	 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE You can imagine this every day, every month.	 
So many people come here, but we don't know about them at all.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE Eight years.	 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE Eight, nine, eight years.	 
NEELY (voice-over) And his crime for eight years in jail?	 
He prayed too much and was seen as a dangerous radical. (on camera): More cells. (voice-over): But the Mukhabarat headquarters had more horrors to reveal.	 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE And they tied their hands behind and hung them and hung them for many days.

So desperate are they to tell their story that they began reenacting what they and their brothers and friends have suffered.

More than 65 journalists of many nationalities died in Southeast Asia .	
ABC News producer David Kaplan was killed by sniper fire in the Balkans in 1992.

The casualty count helps put the ongoing debate about journalistic neutrality into a sharper light.	
The 600 journalists embedded with American troops in Iraq will be threatened by the same fire as the troops they are covering.	American PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-9" type="COUNTRY",Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
Their safety, their lives, may depend on those troops.	
Neutrality in a firefight?	
Not likely.	
And that raises a bigger question.	
Are they supposed to be neutral on the outcome of the war?	
In an interview with broadcasting and cable magazine, CBS News President Andrew Heyward said of the neutrality notion -- quote -- "It's one of the stupidest things I've ever heard.	
This story is going to be told from a U.S. point of view.	U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-10" type="COUNTRY"
We are American reporters, the ones with the troops." (on camera): Now, none of this means journalists will ignore unsettling news: military setbacks, lack of supplies, the infliction of civilian casualties.	American PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-9" type="COUNTRY"
Reporters who ignore or distort facts are betraying their craft no matter what and no matter how much that may anger the people running a war.	
But whether in the old Soviet Union or Nazi Germany or South Africa or Iraq , respect for the facts does not require a reporter to throw his values over the side.

John, they have to be happy there.	 
JOHN KING, CNN SNR.	 
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT Judy, they are.	 
Behind the scenes privately here you get a palpable sense of vindication, although publicly caution is the watchword here, administration officials from the vice president on down saying the war is not over yet.	 
Some of the toughest fighting could still be ahead.	 
Mostly they believe in those northern Iraq areas Brent Sadler was just talking about before the break.	 ,Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-24" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY"

Across the Arab world, the administration hopes to send a signal that the United States is there to help the Iraqi people regain control of their own country , as a liberty, not as any imperial or occupying force.

Of course, at the same time, though, the White House worries that the American people might see these pictures and think the war is over.	 ,American PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-9" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and Vice President Cheney among those saying the toughest fighting might still lie ahead, still unanswered questions about the whereabouts of Saddam Hussein and other key members of the Iraqi leadership.	 ,Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-24" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY",Iraqi PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-23" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
The vice president made that argument today.	 
But even as he sounds that note of caution, you do sense a little tiny bit of we told you so.	 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DICK CHENEY, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES Bottom line, with less than half of the ground forces and two-thirds of the air assets used 12 years ago in Desert Storm, Secretary Rumsfeld and General Franks have achieved a far more difficult objective.	 ,UNITED STATES PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" type="COUNTRY"
Yet until this war is fully won, we cannot be overconfident in our position.	 
And we must not underestimate the desperation of whatever forces remain loyal to the dictator.	 
(END VIDEO CLIP) KING We will not hear from the president today, we are told, but before the week is out and perhaps as early as tomorrow officials say the president is likely to offer his thoughts on the challenges just ahead.	 
So, again, behind the scenes, a sense of vindication, but also a cautious attitude because of the fighting still to come.	 
I have to tell you, though, Judy, the CIA Director George Tenet walked out of the White House a short time ago with a giant smile on his face.	 
I cannot recall a moment since September 11, 2001 and those tragic events when we have seen the CIA director look so happy.	 
WOODRUFF Well, John, given all that you've said, we know that there's an American retired general waiting in Kuwait .	 ,American PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-9" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY",Kuwait PLACE country="KW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19210228" id="Pl-27" latLong="29.500°N 47.750°E" type="COUNTRY"
But in addition to that, what steps are they already taking at the White House to plan for a post-Saddam Hussein government in Iraq ?	 ,Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-24" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
KING They are planning to accelerate that planning process.	 
Jay Garner the retired general will go into Iraq soon with his troops soon.	 ,Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-24" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
I say troops.	 
They are civilians from the U.S. government.	 ,U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
That will take place soon.	 
They are awaiting for word from the Pentagon that it believes the security environment is secure enough for that to happen.	 
And beginning as early as next week, there will be a series of town meetings, if you will.	 
The invitations will be issued by General Tommy Franks.	 
They are trying to identify Iraqis from within the country , as well as Iraqi dissidents and exiles, the diaspora they call it here at the White House , who will be part of a planning process to begin the process -- they say it could takes weeks or more -- of selecting who should be part of that interim Iraqi authority.	 ,Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-24" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY",country PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-20" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY",Iraqi PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-23" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
Now, we know, one person who will be invited is planning process, those planning meetings, is Ahmed Chalabi.	 
He is the leader of the Iraqi National Congress.	 ,Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-24" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY",Iraqi PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-23" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
He is known to be a favorite of Vice President Dick Cheney, of Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and Secretary Rumsfeld's top deputy, Paul Wolfowitz.	 
He will be involved in the planning and in those meetings.	 
But I also should report that there is a sense of annoyance here at the White House , even among some of Mr. Chalabi's top supporters, that, since returning to Iraq in recent days, he has complained frequently, including on our air earlier today, that the United States is moving too slowly to get in the reconstruction efforts, to restore electricity and restore water.

CUPOLO He was sent over right next to the Persian Gulf now since New Year's Eve.	
And this is one of many deployments he's been on, but this one is probably the most crucial.	
ROBERTS Her second-graders were very interested in sending some letters out to the troops.	
CUPOLO So, I knew that, at one point or another, my children needed to write.	
I thought that would be a real uplifting experience for the troops.	
ROBERTS And she says: "Dear brave friend.	
Hello.	
My name is Amanda." UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE "We would have to say that you are a very brave person.	
When the war starts, your heart will be in our souls."	
ROBERTS For these kids to takes time to read letters to us and stuff like that in their class, what more can you ask?

You might want to mention that in your letter as well.	
KAGAN This time, they hope the sailors will write back with answers to their questions.	
CUPOLO So you want to know how fast the dolphins there are swimming?	
OK.	
I would write that down.	
I would say: "Dear, friend, I have some questions for you.	
I want to know about the dolphins that are helping you out over there."	
Can you do that?	
Do you think you could ask them a question?	
Sure.	
They will be happy to answer it.	
We started work on our letters the last week of February and worked on them the first week of March and sent them out a few weeks ago.	
And they got the letters pretty quickly over there.	
But I think this helps me stay closer to my brother.

LAITH KUBBA, PRESIDENT, IRAQI NATIONAL GROUP It is a huge sigh of relief, because it could have been much worse and Baghdad could have been a war theater with more destruction to property.

And, obviously, there are four million people who could have suffered more.	
So, there is a sigh of relief that it is not worse.	
But, obviously, there is a great, great concern about the scenes that you've been showing on television.	
WOODRUFF Are you talking to family members now in Baghdad and around Iraq ?	Baghdad PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-28" latLong="33.339Â°N 44.394Â°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC",Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-20" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY"

KUBBA Well, not in the recent three or four days.	
There are no phone lines to Baghdad .	Baghdad PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-28" latLong="33.339Â°N 44.394Â°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC"
In other parts of Iraq , I received with great sadness the killing of one close colleague, Saeed Abu Naji Abhuey (ph) in Najaf .

He was not killed by former members of the Baath Party or the security of the army, but by just a local organized group.	
So those signs to me are worrying.	
People are sensing and feeling the lack of authority or the power vacuum and are testing it.	
And the more they test, the more I think they are claiming.	
WOODRUFF How difficult will it be to sort out who will next hold power in Iraq after this transition period, however long it is, where the U.S. is in charge?

KUBBA Well, one needs to break down this process into various elements.	
Today, there should be an authority.	
And it's very likely that the U.S. and the British forces are the authority on land.

And there ought to be administration.	
And this ought to be primarily by Iraqis.	Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-20" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY",Iraqi PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-19" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
But when it comes to government, I think we really need to map out step by step how to move from this power vacuum to the day we have elections.	
We need to involve the U.N. We need to involve all Iraqi forces in the country , outside the country .	Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-20" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY",country PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-23" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY",Iraqi PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-19" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
But we need to do it quickly, because every day passes by with this vacuum, it's going to spell trouble.	
WOODRUFF Well, we know, Mr. Kubba, there are several Iraqi exiles groups competing for influence.

WOODRUFF So does one group have an advantage over another now?	
KUBBA There are different groups who have advantage over others in different parts of the country . Unfortunately, we do not have a national group that can appeal to Iraqis as Iraqis within a credible voice.This needs to be constructed, maybe through a conference to be held in Baghdad , where representatives from provinces all over Iraq need to participate, as well as political groups.

Some we'll never know.	
For others, the stories can be seen in their injuries.	
Nobody knows these stories better than the Devil Docs, Naval corpsmen who never look the other way, but rather face what needs to be done without flinching.	
They are often the first faces the injured see, be they Iraqi or coalition force members.

This is the closest front line surgical company.	
Corpsmen quickly take patients by ambulance away from the blowing sand to a triage tent.

BLITZER Welcome back to LATE EDITION.	
We return now to my interview earlier today with the United States defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld.	United States PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" type="COUNTRY"

Syria PLACE country="SY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17451884" id="Pl-9" latLong="35.000°N 38.000°E" type="COUNTRY",Iraqi PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY",Syrian PLACE country="SY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17451884" id="Pl-8" latLong="35.000°N 38.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
Has the situation improved, especially in the aftermath now of the secretary of state's meeting with Bashar al-Asad?	
RUMSFELD Well, I guess time will tell.	
I talked to Secretary Powell this morning on the phone a bit, and it's not, I think you need to let the dust settle on that.	
He's, in my judgment, had a visit that was worth doing, and the president asked him to do it, and it was the right thing to do.	
We'll see what progress comes.	
You know, words are one thing, actions are another.	
BLITZER But right now you're open-minded as far as Syria on whether they will crack down on terrorism, take some of the other steps that you want them to take?	Syria PLACE country="SY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17451884" id="Pl-9" latLong="35.000°N 38.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
RUMSFELD I know what they've been doing, and it's been unhelpful.	
I know that Secretary Powell was just there and advised them that it was unhelpful, and gave them some pointers and some suggestions for the future.	
In my view, they were making some unwise decisions previously.	
What they'll do after this visit remains to be seen.	
BLITZER The secretary of state has written you a letter expressing, apparently, some concern about the length that the prisoners are going to be spending, those detained at the U.S. Naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba , about 600 or so of them.	Cuba PLACE country="CU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18380782" id="Pl-14" latLong="21.500°N 80.000°W" type="COUNTRY",U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-6" type="COUNTRY",Guantanamo Bay PLACE country="CU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18375476" id="Pl-11" latLong="20.003°N 75.133°W" type="WATER"
Is there any movement in trying to determine the fate of these individuals?	
RUMSFELD I don't think that's quite accurate as to what he wrote me about.	
BLITZER All right, tell me what.	
.. what..	
. what...	
RUMSFELD I think what he wrote me about was the fact that the inter-agency process, where we have all these FBI and Department of Justice and CIA and DIA, and what have you, involved in interrogating these detainees, it takes time to find out what intelligence they have.	
It also takes time to figure out what law enforcement process might be appropriate, and what Colin and I have been concerned about, both of us, is that it's taking so long.	
There are a number of countries, and the Department of State has the responsibility of dealing with those countries, that have foreign nationals in Gitmo , in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , being detained, and those countries, understandably, would like to know when they could have those people.So the inter-agency process takes a great deal of time.	Cuba PLACE country="CU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18380782" id="Pl-14" latLong="21.500°N 80.000°W" type="COUNTRY",Gitmo PLACE country="CU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18375476" id="Pl-12" latLong="20.003°N 75.133°W" type="WATER",Guantanamo Bay PLACE country="CU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18375476" id="Pl-11" latLong="20.003°N 75.133°W" type="WATER"
Colin and I are trying to speed up that process, and that's what that's all about.	
BLITZER Let me just, a couple of nuggets to sort of wrap up before I let you go.	
Victory parades for the troops.	
I remember covering General Schwarzkopf, the parades in Washington and New York after the first Gulf War.	Washington PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-16" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="DC" type="PPLC",New York PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-18" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="NY" type="PPL"
Do you want the troops to be honored in that way when they come back, to have parades in New York , Washington , elsewhere?	Washington PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-16" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="DC" type="PPLC",New York PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-18" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="NY" type="PPL"
RUMSFELD There's no question but that the troops, the young men and women, did such a superb job that there has to be a way to honor them, and there will be.	
And General Franks and his team have done just a superb job for our country and for the world, and indeed for the Iraqi people, who have been liberated.	country PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-7" type="COUNTRY",Iraqi PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
What's the best way to do that?	
In the case of 1991, the task was to go in and get them out of Kuwait , and they did it, and they were properly greeted coming back to the United States .	United States PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" type="COUNTRY",Kuwait PLACE country="KW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19210228" id="Pl-20" latLong="29.500°N 47.750°E" type="COUNTRY"
In this instance, it was a very different task.	
It was to remove that regime, and it's part of a global war on terrorism that is not over.	
We still have to face the problem of a number of global terrorist networks and terrorist states that exist, that work with those global networks.	
And on the one hand we will, in fact, find a way to honor the courage and dedication and talent of these young men and women, and we'll do it well.	
Whether it will be modeled off the 1991 thing, I don't know.	
I kind of doubt it, because it's such a different circumstance.	
Certainly, our war plan was not modeled off of 1991.	
BLITZER One final question on North Korea .	North Korea PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-21" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY"

.. ambitions..	
. ambitions...	
RUMSFELD Yes.	
BLITZER ... a preemptive strike, is that something that is out there?	
RUMSFELD I'm not one who speculates about things like that.	
I know that back in the 1990s, in the Clinton administration, Secretary Perry called in the former secretaries of defense, and we had a discussion, and they clearly had teed up a military option that they were considering, and they then at a certain moment were able to do some things that persuaded them that that was not appropriate.	
But those are very serious issues, and I leave them for the president.

And here in Washington , Democratic Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut . Senators, welcome back to LATE EDITION.	Washington PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-10" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="US-DC" type="PPL",Connecticut PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780780" id="Pl-11" latLong="41.667°N 72.667°W" state="US-CT" type="CIVIL"
Mr. Chairman, let me begin with you.	
Are you among those who are beginning to conclude that, when all the dust settles, the U.S. may not find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq ?	U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-15" type="COUNTRY",Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
SEN. RICHARD LUGAR (R), INDIANA No, I concur with Secretary Powell, Secretary Rumsfeld, the president, that weapons of mass destruction are there, and likewise, that we will be led to them by people knowledgeable in the country as to where they are.	country PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-17" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY",INDIANA PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:449508" id="Pl-16" latLong="40.000°N 86.250°W" state="US-IN" type="CIVIL"
What form we may find them and what traces of destruction and all the rest of it will be very interesting and, likewise, the intellectual capital that is there to produce more.	
Because not much else is -- you don't need much to get it going again.	
And that, I think, we have to be working with these people who are in the business to make sure they don't re-enter the business, much as we did with Russian scientists under the Nunn-Lugar program.	Russian PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-18" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
BLITZER What about you, Senator Dodd, do you believe, in the end, they will find weapons of mass destruction?	
SEN. CHRISTOPHER DODD (D), CONNECTICUT I have no evidence to the contrary.	CONNECTICUT PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780780" id="Pl-19" latLong="41.667°N 72.667°W" state="US-CT" type="CIVIL"
And certainly, they have used them in the past.	
There's no doubt about that at all, both in Iran and against the Kurdish population.	Iran PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16932748" id="Pl-20" latLong="32.000°N 53.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
So, whether or not they find them in the exact form that many would assume they would be the case -- possibly some got out of the country.	country PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-17" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
It wouldn't surprise me to hear that.	
But I'm going to work on the assumption, based on the intelligence that has been gathered, that the weapons of mass destruction existed.	
BLITZER What if they don't?	
DODD Well, you know, they've used it in the past, and I think the point that Senator Lugar just made -- certainly having the intellectual capacity to do this was proven already by the fact they've used them in the past.	
So, I wouldn't dwell on that point specifically, because Saddam Hussein clearly was a producer and a user of biological and chemical weapons.	
He clearly was on the track to acquire a nuclear capacity, and the world is a safer place today because he's not ruling Iraq .	Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
BLITZER Will the U.S. lose creditability, Mr. Chairman, if, if the U.S. finds no hard evidence, no so-called smoking gun?	U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-15" type="COUNTRY"
LUGAR No, we have full credibility in Iraq .	Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
We've prosecuted with the alliance a successful liberation of the Iraqi people, and we have clearly caused Saddam to destroy weapons of mass destruction, or at least to suppress evidence of them.	Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY",Iraqi PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-6" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
That is a victory of sorts.This is a facet that's important.	
It's important in the war against terrorism that we rout out whatever is there and, likewise, the people involved, because they might help supply al Qaeda or other terrorists along the trail.	
BLITZER Senator Dodd, how important is it for the U.S. to conclusively learn what happened to Saddam Hussein?	U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-15" type="COUNTRY"
DODD Well, it's important.	
But I don't think it's as important as finding Osama bin Laden, for the simple reason that I don't think Saddam Hussein today poses any threat, wherever he is.	
If he is alive, obviously, he doesn't pose the kind of threat that an Osama bin Laden does with his cellular network around the world to reactivate al Qaeda and international terrorism.	
So, it would certainly be good to know where he is.	
It would be, certainly, to know, to apprehend him, to bring him before a court of justice.	
But I don't think it's absolutely critical for the ultimate success of this mission that we apprehend him or find out what happened to him.	
BLITZER And you agree with that assessment, Mr. Chairman?	
LUGAR Yes, I think that Senator Dodd is right on.	
 Interview With Donald Rumsfeld; Lugar, Dodd Talk About Post-War Iraq  ;	Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
BLITZER What about the length of the U.S. military presence in Iraq , Senator Lugar?	U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-9" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY",Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
How long do you anticipate large numbers of U.S. troops will remain there?	U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-9" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
LUGAR Well, I was heartened by what Secretary Rumsfeld told you in the last interview, that we will have troops there as long as necessary, but no longer than necessary.	
I think that's a pretty good way to state it.	
My own view is that the security of the country clearly is our responsibility presently.	
We are trying to pass that on to others.	
Likewise, the other government's procedures, the fledgling beginnings on democracy, and all the rest.	
But that's going to require an undergirding.	
Now, in due course, as everybody points out, we may get help from other countries.	
We may bring in NATO allies or the United Nations or other people in the Arab world.	
That would be helpful.	
But for the moment, this is our responsibility.	
And we ought not to be having large debates about how rapidly we move out.	
And I was upset, in a way, to hear reports that by the fall, three divisions out of five would be gone.	
I think Secretary Rumsfeld disabused us of that today.	
BLITZER And what about you, Senator Dodd, not only the length of time, but the cost to U.S. taxpayers?	U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-9" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
Have you been given any ballpark estimate what this is going to cost the United States ?	United States PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-11" type="COUNTRY"
DODD No.	
Well, what we've heard the numbers of reconstruction running around $100 billion.	
We put $2.5 billion in, in the last supplemental appropriations bill.	
So it's going to be costly.	
These RFPs, these seeking bids on various contracts are rather costly, and so it's going to be expensive.	
And clearly the responsibility is going to fall principally on the United States .	United States PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-11" type="COUNTRY"
Now, I would hope that sooner rather than later we could see a civilian government emerge in Iraq , a democratically elected one, that there'd be more cooperation from the international community, on both the peacekeeping side as well as the political restructuring that's necessary in Iraq .	Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
And to the extent we can move that along more quickly, I think we're all going to be better off.	
Being the sole, or almost the sole power there, both in terms of reconstruction and politically, exposes us to great vulnerabilities.	
BLITZER Senator Lugar, we have to take a quick break, but before we do, I wanted to just ask you, the U.N. role -- you say there could be a U.N. role.	
Do you specifically want the United Nations to have some sort of peacekeeping role there?	
And secondarily, what about countries like France , Germany , and Russia , which opposed the Bush administration's war plans, do you want them shut out?	France PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18572019" id="Pl-12" latLong="46.000°N 2.000°E" type="COUNTRY",Russia PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-14" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" type="COUNTRY",Germany PLACE country="DE" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18224345" id="Pl-13" latLong="51.500°N 10.500°E" type="COUNTRY"
LUGAR No, I don't want anybody shut out.	
And I do hope the United Nations will play a vital role in Iraq , whether it be in peacekeeping or various other ways, and I hope that that will occur soon.	Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
I think we really need an internationalization of the process, for the very reasons that Senator Dodd pointed out.	
BLITZER All right.	
We're going to take that quick break.	
Stand by, Senators.	
We have a lot more ground to cover.	
Senators Lugar and Dodd will be staying with us.	
They'll also be taking your phone calls.

KING Senator Hutchison, your response?	
HUTCHISON Well, I think that everyone is saying the same thing.	
We are very concerned.	
This is a huge country and we have porous borders and our ports are vulnerable.	country PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" type="COUNTRY"
There's no question about it.	
And I know Steve did a really strong piece on that just recently.	
And I think a lot is being done, but are we finished, are we where we need to be, absolutely not.	
KING Spokane , Washington , as we go to some calls.	Washington PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780804" id="Pl-6" latLong="47.500°N 120.500°W" state="WA" type="CIVIL",Spokane PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1513683" id="Pl-7" latLong="47.659°N 117.425°W" state="WA" type="PPL"
Hello.	
CALLER My question is for Senator Hutchison.	
Thank you for taking my call.	
She states Saddam does have these weapons of mass destruction.	
In her opinion, where are they if he does and why are our boys still dying after the death of Uday and Qusay Hussein, what credibility does President Bush have left after lying about.	
.. about..	
. about...	
KING That's a lot of questions.	
Synthesize that Kay.	
HUTCHISON We know he has chemical weapons because he used them on his own people up in the north against the Kurds.	north PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-8" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="N" type="COUNTRY"
And so with that kind of information, we are looking for other evidence, and I think we will find it.	
But I don't know where.	
But I do know that it is important that we continue to look for it and find it.	
I am very concerned about the deaths of our soldiers, that just seem to happen every day or every other day.	
And I think that is keeping America on edge.	
But I do think finding Saddam Hussein will make a big difference.	
We're not getting the cooperation from the people because they are afraid that if they help Americans they will be killed themselves or Saddam Hussein will come back and begin the torture of these people who helped Americans.	
So, it has been very difficult for our people to get the information that we need to find Saddam Hussein and show the Iraqi people that this man is gone, and they will be able to have a life if they will work with us give themselves a chance at freedom.

And I..	
. I...	
KING Didn't Cheney just.	
.. just..	
. just...	
REAGAN And I put it back into use after it had been grounded.	
And I think that this -- things of this kind reflect our great technology, our technological superiority over so many potential enemies.	
KING You disagree with cuts then?	
REAGAN But what?	
KING You disagree with cuts in it?	
REAGAN Well, yes, although I understand that with all the over spending that's done and the national deficit, the only place where the Congress ever seems to show had a desire to cut is in military.	
When I took office, I found that on any given day 50 percent of our military aircraft couldn't fly for lack of spare parts.	
Now this is just disgraceful.	
And as I say, that's the only place where they seem to want to cut.	
Every budget that I submitted they put on the shelf and said it was dead on arrival.	
Then they would send back to me a continuing resolution, which was their form of budget.	
Every time my budget was far lower than the money they wanted to spend.	
KING We're hop scotching in lots of places.	
Are you surprised Gorbachev has hung on this long?	
REAGAN Well, yes, because, you know, that vested aristocracy there, all of those Politburo members and so forth, they're frightened that a change in the system is going to take away their perquisites, just as he closed down their private stores where they could go in without waiting on line and they could choose from any one of a half a dozen meats, where the Russian citizens had to stand hours in line and there would only be one kind of meat when they did get in the store.	Russian PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-4" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
KING Did you like him right away?	
REAGAN I'll tell you, there was something.	
Because having known previous leaders -- there were three before he came along.	
They kept dying on me.	
And in our first meeting, as we came together with my team and his team, I had told our people what I was going to do.	
And that was, as we started to sit down, I said to him, why don't you and I let our teams start this discussion and you and I go out and get some fresh air?	
He was out of his chair before I finished the sentence.	
So we walked down to the edge of the lake, where there was a kind of a house there, a bath house, that belonged to the building where we were together.	
And we went in, and we had a little conversation.	
We had to have interpreters, but we had a little conversation between us.	
And... KING You liked him right away?	
REAGAN Yes, and I told him, for example, that -- we were there.	
I said, we don't mistrust each other because we're armed -- this is a quote of someone else -- we're armed because we mistrust each other.	
So in addition to talking about reducing the weaponry and so forth, why don't we see if we can reduce the causes of mistrust.	
And I said, the only thing left to us otherwise is to go back to an arms race, and then I made my declaration.	
I looked him right in the eye and I said, "and that's a race you can't win.	
There is no way we're going to allow you to maintain a superiority in weapons over us."

You didn't go to journalism school.	
Why did you want this job?	
LEMANN Well, because the president of the university, who is relatively new, and the provost of the university, who is brand new, both of whom are children of journalists, have made it a top priority of theirs to really pour money and attention into taking the school to the next level.	
So it's a very exciting opportunity to, you know, explore the outer limits of what can be done in journalism education.	
KURTZ But you know, you don't need a license or a permit or a degree to practice journalism.	
Some would say why do we need j schools at all?	
LEMANN The good analogy would be business schools.	
You know, the question is not need; the question is, is there value added for the people who go there?	
You don't need to have gone to business school, you know, the poster child for Columbia Business School, of course, is Warren Buffett.	
He would say he got his money's worth out of going to Columbia Business School and I think nobody can argue with that.	
So one of the great things about journalism is that you don't have to have gone to journalism school.	
I myself started my career at age 17 at an alternative paper, so I'm a beneficiary of the lack of credentials, but I do think that at a great university like Columbia, we're the only Ivy League graduate-only journalism school, you can draw on the extraordinary riches of the university, of New York City , of the media industry that's pretty much headquartered here, and of the faculty and alumni of this school and really provide something special for the people who go there.	New York City PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-3" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="NY" type="PPL",New York PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-2" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="NY" type="PPL"
So the question is not do all journalists have to go there?	
They don't.	
It is a voluntary thing, and that's good.	
It gives us a fair test of value.	
If the question is, will -- do and will the people who go to Columbia Journalism School feel over the long term that they got something useful out of it, I hope we can answer that with a resounding yes.	
KURTZ Let me read you a skeptical column by "Newsweek's" Robert Samuelson.	
He says Columbia's president, Lee Bollinger's -- that "Bollinger's haughty vision seems confirmed by his choice for the dean of the journalism school, Nicholas Lemann.	
He is a brilliant writer, an exhaustive reporter, a gifted thinker, and from everything I know a nice guy."	
Not bad.	
But, "he has specialized in long, reflective articles to upscale, that elite publications, with comparatively small circulations.	
Most recently "The Atlantic Monthly" and "The New Yorker."	New York PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-2" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="NY" type="PPL"
Most reporters do less exalted work."	
Do you plead guilty to being an elitist?	
LEMANN No, I don't.	
I mean, first of all my goal in going to the school is not to turn everybody into, you know, mini me.	
Second of all, just on a small point, I believe "The New Yorker" now has a bigger circulation than "The Washington Post" so, you know, who is calling who a small circulation publication?	New York PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-2" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="NY" type="PPL",Washington PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-4" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="DC" type="PPL"
It is smaller than "Newsweek." Look, the question is, you know, if you're fortunate enough to be able to get it, as Bob Samuelson himself was, can education at a great research university help you over the long term?	
Yes, it can.	
We're not making everybody go to journalism school.	
We're saying we can provide an educational experience that will enrich your career as a journalist, particularly by making it possible for you to have a kind of deeper, richer understanding of the complexities of the world you'll have to cover.	
KURTZ You're starting to sound like an academic.	
The Jayson Blair scandal obviously has kind of cast a pall over the news business.	
All of these scandals, some of them involving young journalists, going back to Steven Glass and others, would seem to suggest perhaps that journalism schools are not doing as great a job as they might at imparting journalistic ethics.	
Is that an area that needs more attention?	
LEMANN Well, I'm going to give you the same refrain which is all journalists didn't go to journalism school.	
Journalism schools aren't in charge of making sure that in the out years over decades that nobody does anything dishonest in journalism.	
KURTZ Is it something that you would put an emphasis on?	
LEMANN It already is a very heavy emphasis at the school and will continue to be.	
Knock on wood, none of these cases so far has involved a Columbia Journalism School grad, and I hope you continue to behave yourself, Howie, as well.	
KURTZ I'll do my best to uphold the traditions.	
We'll have to leave it there.	
Good luck in your new job, Nick Lemann.	
Thanks for joining us.	
LEMANN Thank you.	
KURTZ Still to come, why the media keep on obsessing about the Kennedys whether they're dead or alive.

DAVIS We'll get to that story in a moment.	
But first, we're going to go to outside Moscow , to our correspondent Jill Dougherty, who is covering explosions at a rock concert -- Jill.	Moscow PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17039439" id="Pl-4" latLong="55.752°N 37.616°E" state="MOS" type="PPLC"

You know, we're just down the street from where that happened.	street PLACE country="RU" form="NOM" id="Pl-49" type="FAC"
It's right outside a big air base called Tushino , where a concert, a rock concert called Wings was taking place.	Tushino PLACE country="RU" form="NOM" id="Pl-39" type="FAC",base PLACE country="RU" form="NOM" id="Pl-38" type="FAC"
There were about 20,000 people inside that stadium .	stadium PLACE country="RU" form="NOM" id="Pl-47" type="FAC"
And luckily, if you can say it's lucky, the two explosions took place outside of the stadium , apparently at the entrance .	stadium PLACE country="RU" form="NOM" id="Pl-47" type="FAC"
In fact, we're just close to that entrance a few minutes ago, where two female suicide bombers tried to get into the stadium .	stadium PLACE country="RU" form="NOM" id="Pl-47" type="FAC"
That is the latest information that we have.	
It went up toward the gate.	
We're not allowed to go in.	
And one woman exploded whatever she had, the type of explosives, destroying herself and killing reportedly three people at that point.	
And then about 15 minutes later, the other explosion by the other woman at another gate.	
You can still see, in fact, and I was down there as I said just a minute ago, you can still see two bodies lying on the street , and police are obviously taking forensic evidence and trying to figure out precisely how it happened, but I could say that it would appear to fit that scenario of having the two females suicide bombers.	street PLACE country="RU" form="NOM" id="Pl-49" type="FAC"
The people who were inside the stadium really did not know what was going on.	stadium PLACE country="RU" form="NOM" id="Pl-47" type="FAC"
But outside the stadium , the latest reports, 18 people killed, and many wounded, although we don't have a final figure on that.	stadium PLACE country="RU" form="NOM" id="Pl-47" type="FAC"
The latest was 20, but the numbers have been increasing.	
Back to you.	
DAVIS Jill, have there been any claims of responsibility, Jill?	
DOUGHERTY Not that we have heard, although you would have to say that this really does have the fingerprint of Chechen terrorists.	Chechen PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17103517" id="Pl-7" latLong="43.300°N 45.700°E" state="CE" type="CIVIL"
After all, just in the past month or so, we have had a couple of incidents in Chechnya and the region in the south of Russia of females suicide bombers with explosives strapped to their waist, blowing themselves up, and killing people besides.	Chechnya PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17103517" id="Pl-9" latLong="43.300°N 45.700°E" state="CE" type="CIVIL",Russia PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-10" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" mod="S" type="COUNTRY"
So this would appear to fit that description.	
And also, police are saying that they found the passport of one of the women, a girl, 20 years old, who does have a name that is Chechen .	Chechen PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17103517" id="Pl-7" latLong="43.300°N 45.700°E" state="CE" type="CIVIL"

Do the Russian people support his moves on the security issues against the Chechens?

DOUGHERTY Well, if they're cracking down on security in Moscow , you would have to say that people do support that by and large, because they're scared.	Moscow PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17039439" id="Pl-4" latLong="55.752°N 37.616°E" state="MOS" type="PPLC"
You know, they're worried.	
Remember last October, you had the theater hostage crisis, and people want security.	theater PLACE country="RU" form="NOM" id="Pl-48" predicative="true" type="FAC"
Now, if you're talking about the crackdowns in Chechnya , there you have to say that it's kind of a mixed bag.	Chechnya PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17103517" id="Pl-9" latLong="43.300°N 45.700°E" state="CE" type="CIVIL"
Many people think they ought to simply get rid of the terrorists, do whatever they can and get tough, but there are other people who believe that it's precisely that type of get tough and round them up type of approach that's spurring on the violence and -- by the Chechens.	Chechen PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17103517" id="Pl-7" latLong="43.300°N 45.700°E" state="CE" type="CIVIL"
But you'd have to say, also, that and it is fair to say that there is an element of international terrorism, as well.	
It is not just, you know, rebels in Chechnya wanting to be free.	Chechnya PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17103517" id="Pl-9" latLong="43.300°N 45.700°E" state="CE" type="CIVIL"

And officials were telling me, they can't even get the people in for traffic court without a line in the mornings.	
What are they going to do when hundreds of media, like us, are camped outside waiting to get into that trial?	
It is going to be a log jam according to the city .

DAVIS It could be.	
Well, that's very interesting, because in fact, John Muhammad, Malvo's alleged accomplice, has also asked for a change of venue.	
We could see that going on maybe at the same time.	
Muhammad's trial scheduled for October; Malvo for November.	
But it depends how long that first one goes.	
We could have them both happening at the same time.

I don't know.	
BASH This is obviously something that the defense was asking for.	
They wanted it to be moved, because they didn't think that they could get a fair jury in the Washington , D.C. area, but isn't it something that the prosecution might not be too unhappy about, because if he were convicted in Washington , it would be sort of you would think top of the list for the appeal for the defense.	Washington PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-17" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" predicative="true" state="DC" type="PPL",D.C.

This way, it's harder to make the argument that he didn't get a fair trial.	
DAVIS It does take away one of the possible points of appeal, if they do grant him a change of venue, and the judge really was saying that it's only fair here.	
Look at the publicity you have had.	city PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:1497841" id="Pl-14" latLong="36.819°N 76.275°W" state="VA" type="PPL"
Also, you have a book coming out by Chief Charles Moose.	
That's coming out mid-September, and both of these lawyers in both of these cases have worried that that may somehow be read by people in Virginia and that could somehow taint a jury pool, as well.	Virginia PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:30126100" id="Pl-5" latLong="37.500°N 78.500°W" state="VA" type="CIVIL"
In fact, Muhammad's lawyer filed with in federal court asking the federal judge, please delay the coming of that book in September.	
Make it come after the trial, because we're worried about that.	
We want to get a fair trial here.	
STARR This Chief Moose book is still really big news, at least here in the Washington Metropolitan Area.	Washington PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-17" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" predicative="true" state="DC" type="PPL"
A lot of people have a lot of opinions about it.	
Have any of the families of the victims of the snipers spoken about their feelings about Chief Moose making money on this book, off this tragedy?	
DAVIS Well, he is billing it as an inside story.	
This is his life.	
But lawyers are saying, well, wait a second, it's going to be a lot more than just his life.	
It's going to be about what happened, and the case and how they tracked these two alleged murderers down.	
But yes, there are members of families, some of them saying, we really think this is not a good move on the part of Chief Moose.	
Of course he has a right to go out and write a book, but can't he wait, at least a little while, until at least the trial gets under way?	
They don't want there to be any chance of tainting the jury as well.	
They want a conviction if indeed these two are found guilty.	
STARR Because, of course, I mean, I think it's the case that Chief Moose singlehandedly didn't solve the case.	
DAVIS It was an FBI involvement, as well.	
Absolutely. Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, a large panoply of officials who were involved in solving this.	
You're right.	
So it was a multipronged effort on all fronts.	
STARR So it should be a really interesting fall here in the Metropolitan area . DAVIS Oh, it's going to be wild, that's for sure.	Metropolitan area PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-19" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="DC" type="PPL"

 Arafat Dead at Last	
2004-11-13T15:28:00 Welcome all to my new site.	
I've decided to incorporate my old work blog into a general blog, the work diary is up on the right titled "my work diary".	
EFF YEAH!	
BUSH WON!	
OK then.	
My next thought.	
The world is a much better place now that the terrorist Yassar Arafat is dead.	
Here is a good one minute video on his great legacy Here .	
This guy was one of the early innovators of terrorism in this century and he is protrayed by the Main Stream Media (MSM for short) as a "freedom fighter".	
Because of him millions of palestinians chose "jihad" over peace with Isreal .	Isreal PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-1" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY"
He innovated suicide bombers and plane hijacking plus he embezzelled hundreds of millions of dollars from aid funds....and this guy got a nobel peace prize, what a disgrace.	
UPDATE 1 - Drudge is reporting that Arafat has been skimming 2 million a month from the gasoline trade in the territories MAG: Arafat Skimmed $2 Million a Month From the Gas Trade Sun Nov 14 2004 09:53:40 ET New York -- Last year auditors discovered Arafat was guilty of skimming $2 million a month from the gasoline trade in the territories, TIME reports.

In the mid-1990s, Arafat controlled a financial empire worth at least $3 billion.	
By the time of his death, he was down to his last $1 billion, according to Israeli -intelligence estimates.Arafat wife Suha's outburst that his successors were "trying to bury [him] alive" came after she learned that Arafat had signed over at least $800 million to the government of the Palestinian Authority two years ago, TIME reports.

 Condi the New Secretary of State	
2004-11-15T16:13:00 Just reported from AP that Condi Rice has been chosen by President Bush to become the new Secretary of State for his second term.	
I agree with his choice and think she will make a much better Secretary then Powell did.	
Her views are much more in step with the President then Powell, although he was a true soldier and carried the message.	
Plus, any lady who works out to Led Zeppelin and is a Football nut is alright in my book.

There is now. . . . in an Israeli prison a man named Marwan Barghouti, who is one of the young guard of Palestinians, and if the Palestinians are going to make this work against the really hard-line elements, the Islamists and some of the people of Hamas, they're going to have to have a coalition of the young guard and the old guard."

Gotta say that this shocked me, I've always thought Mr. Baker was a upstanding guy but this is just plain good old fashioned bullcrap.	
Here are some of the fine achievements of the terrorist Marwan Barghouti Marwan Barghouti (born June 6, 1958) is a Palestinian leader from the West Bank and a leader of the Fatah movement that forms the backbone of the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).

On June 6, 2004, he was sentenced to five life sentences for five murders of Israeli civilians and 40 years imprisonment for attempted murders in terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians.

By the summer of 2000, Barghouti and Arafat had grown increasingly at odds with each other, with Barghouti accusing Arafat's administration of corruption and his security services of human rights violations, and Arafat was planning to fire him shortly.	
However, as the Second Intifada began, Barghouti became increasingly popular as a leader of the Fatah Tanzim militia.	
This was perhaps due to the transformation of Tanzim into an organization more resembling militant groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad, responsible for dozens of civilian deaths in drive-by shootings.	
Under Barghouti, the Tanzim has also carried out suicide bombings in Israel under the name al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades.	Israel PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-8" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY"

And I will also say this to you: There are people dying in Iraq , but the reason people are dying is because of the terrorism and the intimidation and the people who are deliberately killing anyone trying to make this country better.

Now what should our response be as an international community?	
Our response should be to stand alongside the democrats--the people who've got the courage to see this thing through--and help them see it through.	
I've got no doubt at all that that is the right thing for us to do. . . . Sometimes when I see some of the reporting of what's happening in Iraq in the rest of the world, I just feel that people should understand how precious what has been created here is.	Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-7" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
And those people from that electoral commission that I described as the heroes of the new Iraq --every day . . . a lot of them aren't living in the Green Zone, they've got to travel in from outside.	Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-7" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
They do not know at any point in time whether they're going to be subject to brutality or intimidation, even death, and yet they carry on doing it.	
Now what a magnificent example of the human spirit--that's the side we should be on.	
 Laser Beam Question	
2004-12-30T18:44:00 This recent news story is troubling in many different ways.	
When I first heard of the story I figured it was some wackjob playing with a new toy but now we find out there have been 7 incidents since Christmas from the West to East coast .

The FBI, concerned that terrorists could use lasers as weapons, is investigating why laser beams were directed into the cockpits of seven airplanes in flight since Christmas.	
Laser beams can temporarily blind or disorient pilots and possibly cause a plane to crash.	
The FBI is looking into two incidents in Colorado Springs , Colo. , and one each in Cleveland , Washington , Houston , Teterboro , N.J. , and Medford , Ore. , according to federal and local law enforcement and transportation officials, some of whom spoke only on condition of anonymity.

A federal law enforcement official, who declined to be identified by name, said Thursday there is no evidence of a plot or terrorist activity.	
But pilots are troubled by the incidents, and the FBI earlier this month warned of the possibility that terrorists might use the devices as weapons.	
"It's not some kid," said Paul Rancatore, a pilot who serves as deputy chairman of the security committee for the Allied Pilots Association.	
"It's too organized."	
Loren Thompson, who teaches military technology at Georgetown University, called it a "rather worrisome development," though he said experts would be more puzzled than alarmed.	Georgetown PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532663" id="Pl-12" latLong="38.905°N 77.063°W" state="DC" type="PPL"
"What we're talking about is a fairly powerful visible light laser that has the ability to lock onto a fast-moving aircraft," Thompson said.	
"That's not the sort of thing you pick up at a military surplus store."	
Thompson said a piece of equipment that could do the things the FBI suspects would be "fairly expensive and fairly sophisticated."	
"It sounds like an organized effort to cause airline accidents," Thompson said.	
Michelle Malkin has a post about this today where some outlets have stopped selling lasers.	
Lots of people think that these indeed might be loonies playing with new Christmas toys but I disagree.	
These are incidents where the Airplanes were tracked , some as high as 8500 feet.	
To track a fast moving plane at that altitude would not be some toy you can get from the local wal-mart.	
In my opinion this is quite alarming.	
This Isn't Writing, It's Typing has a great post out with a ton of info, some of it quite scary A more frightening scenario is that terrorists may have obtained a Chinese -produced ZM-87 laser blinder which is specifically designed to blind eyesight.

The Japanese terrorist cult Aum Shinrikyo--which launched the infamous Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway system in 1995--was discovered to have experimented with the use of lasers as weapons.According to The Asian Pacific Post, "Cult members apparently obtained laser design information from Russian institutes they visited and built a laser weapon mounted on a truck.

PoliticAlex also has some info on this story also.	
I found the following report that was presented to Congress recently about the shoulder launched missle threat to airliners, which this might very well be a precursor to: Recent events have focused attention on the threat that terrorists with shoulder fired surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), referred to as Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS), pose to commercial airliners.	
Most believe that no single solution exists to effectively mitigate this threat.	
Instead, a menu of options may be considered, including installing infrared (IR) countermeasures on aircraft; modifying flight operations and air traffic control procedures; improving airport and regional security; and strengthening missile non-proliferation efforts.	
Equipping aircraft with missile countermeasure systems can protect the aircraft even when operating in areas where ground-based security measures are unavailable or infeasible to implement.	
However, this option has a relatively high cost, between $1 million and $3 million per aircraft, and the time needed for implementation does not allow for immediate response to the existing terrorist threat.	
Procedural improvements such as specific flight crew training, altering air traffic procedures to minimize exposure to the threat, and improved security near airports may be less costly than countermeasures and could more immediately help deter domestic terrorist attacks.	
However, these techniques by themselves cannot completely mitigate the risk of domestic attacks and would not protect U.S. airliners flying to and from foreign airports.	U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-21" type="COUNTRY"
Legislation introduced in the 108th Congress (H.R. 580, S. 311) calls for the installation of missile defense systems in all turbojet aircraft used in scheduled air carrier service.	
While this legislation is still under consideration, Homeland Security appropriations designated $60 million in FY2004 and $61 million in FY2005 to fund a program to develop and test prototype missile countermeasure systems for commercial aircraft based on existing military technology.	
It is anticipated that at the conclusion of this program, in January 2006, the Department of Homeland Security will be able to provide a detailed analysis of the suitability of such systems for use to protect commercial passenger aircraft.	
  Europe  Changing Their Tune?	 
2005-01-01T22:44:00 American Future has a link up to a article written in yesterdays Houston Chronicle.	Houston PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1381948" id="Pl-6" latLong="29.763°N 95.363°W" predicative="true" state="US-TX" type="PPL",American PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
It describes how the European Governments look to be changing their tune in regards to President Bush.	
Why you ask?	
But there is arguably more to this sea change than just a grumpy acceptance of the status quo.	
From a European perspective, three things are making it easier to warm to the Bush White House.	
One is the death of Yasser Arafat.	
No issue divides Europe and the United States more keenly than the Israeli - Palestinian dispute.	United States PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" type="COUNTRY",Israel PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-17" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY",Israeli PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-15" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY",Palestinian PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-19" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
For the last few years, Europeans have criticized Bush for failing to put enough pressure on Israel to get out of the occupied territories and for refusing to deal with Arafat.	Israel PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-17" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY"
That another reason why I respect Bush so much, his refusal to acknowledge that windbag terrorist Arafat.	
May he rot in hell.	
But since Arafat's death, Europeans and Americans have been able to find common ground: supporting Ariel Sharon's withdrawal from Gaza , putting pressure on Israel to let the Palestinians hold elections and, covertly, backing Mahmoud Abbas to become the next Palestinian leader.	Gaza PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19202844" id="Pl-20" latLong="31.417°N 34.333°E" state="PS-GZ" type="CIVIL",American PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY",Israel PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-17" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY",Palestinian PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-19" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
A second reason is Europe 's growing worries about Islamic terrorism.	
The murder in November of Theo van Gogh, a provocative Dutch filmmaker, at the hands of an Islamic militant has been called Europe 's 9 11.	Dutch PLACE country="NL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17850115" id="Pl-21" latLong="52.500°N 5.750°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
Though the two events are obviously not fully comparable, it is certainly true that American conservatives, such as Francis Fukuyama and Bernard Lewis, have found a wider audience recently for the idea that radical Islam is inimical to European traditions of tolerance.	American PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"

The third force is the reappearance, albeit in a milder form, of the threat that kept the trans- Atlantic alliance together for half a century.	
The Russian bear is growling again.	Russian PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-25" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY",Russia PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-27" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" type="COUNTRY"

Hopefully our Government isn't asleep at the wheel with this situation either.	
There is a personal edge to all this.	
Just as the snooty continentals eventually came to admire the gormless Hollywood actor, there is a grudging willingness to rethink some prejudices about the inarticulate Texan .

Many European leaders once swallowed the Michael Moore version of history: that Bush was an ignorant interloper who stole the White House.	
His thumping re-election, however, shows that he represents a large body of conservative American opinion.	American PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
In short, Europeans are getting used to the idea that it is not Bush who is the exception, but the U.S. itself that is exceptional --- and that if they want to deal with this exceptional superpower they need to humor it rather than rile it.

 Liberal Reporter Taking Kickbacks	
2005-02-03T19:53:00 Interesting article at the Accuracy In Media website yesterday.	
It seems a supposed straight shooting reporter with NBC was taking money to fund a book that is so pro-united nations that its almost sickening to read.	
(hat tip Clear and Present ) One of the hottest stories around, the U.N. corruption scandal, NBC has been out to lunch.	
Why?	
Its U.N. reporter has been on the payroll of the U.N. lobby.	
Linda Fasulo, the U.N. correspondent for NBC News and MSNBC, has written a pro-U.N. book, An Insider's Guide to the U.N. , which reads like the U.N. paid for it.	
Actually, the pro-U.N. lobby paid for it.	
In a monstrous conflict of interest for a supposed straight news reporter, Fasulo acknowledges Ted Turner's U.N. Foundation and Better World Campaign for "their generous financial support" of her book project.	
She also thanks the Rockefeller Brothers Fund "for helping to fund the project."	
The book is about "one of the finest and most important governing bodies," she says.	
Of the U.N. chief, she writes like a school girl with a crush.	
"It is hard to find anyone who can mount a serious criticism of [Kofi] Annan's performance as Secretary General," she claims.	
His performance is so "impressive" that she wonders if a "cult of personality" has risen up around him.	
One U.S. official is reported to be "astonished by just how good a Secretary General Kofi Annan has been."	U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" type="COUNTRY"
Yup, you read that right.	
Kofi's performance is soooooo impressive.	
Gag.	
Guess the democrats have their own Armstrong conspiracy to deal with.	
Why would an NBC reporter (who also reports on the U.N. for National Public Radio) take money from the U.N. lobby?	
Perhaps because longtime NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw put his stamp of approval on the UNA- USA and BCUN by acting as master of ceremonies at their 2001 Global Leadership Dinner.	USA PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" type="COUNTRY"
Not surprisingly, Brokaw is listed on the Fasulo book jacket as saying it is a "must-read."	
Another endorsement of the book comes from Barbara Crossette, former New York Times bureau chief at the U.N. who now writes for U.N. Wire, a Ted Turner-funded online news service that covers the U.N. A fascinating part of the book is how Fasulo manages to gloss over Annan's role in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda .	New York PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-4" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" predicative="true" state="US-NY" type="PPL",Rwanda PLACE country="RW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16566130" id="Pl-11" latLong="2.000°S 30.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
She tries to blame the U.S. and other members of the Security Council for not sending enough troops to stop it.	U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" type="COUNTRY"
She admits, however, that, "The Rwanda massacres occurred while Annan was U.N. Undersecretary General for peacekeeping," and that "After he became SG [Secretary General], Annan commissioned a report to examine what had happened and suggest remedies."	Rwanda PLACE country="RW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16566130" id="Pl-11" latLong="2.000°S 30.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
Later, "Annan accepted responsibility for failing to act more quickly," she writes.	
But responsibility for what?	
The truth is that, as director of U.N. peacekeeping, Annan personally refused requests to authorize U.N. peacekeepers in Rwanda to seize weapons and prevent genocide.	Rwanda PLACE country="RW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16566130" id="Pl-11" latLong="2.000°S 30.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
Writer and author Philip Gourevitch has described in detail how, three months before the genocide, Major General Romeo Dallaire, the commander of several thousand U.N. troops in Rwanda , sent a fax to Kofi Annan's office, saying he had received evidence from a Rwandan government informant that genocide was being planned.	Rwandan PLACE country="RW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16566130" id="Pl-12" latLong="2.000°S 30.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY",Rwanda PLACE country="RW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16566130" id="Pl-11" latLong="2.000°S 30.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
The informant offered to help U.N. forces in raiding the government stockpiles to be used in the genocide campaign.	
All that the informant wanted in return was protection for himself and his family.	
But the general needed U.N. authorization to conduct such a raid and save lives.	
He asked for that approval but the answer came back in a now-infamous "genocide fax" from Annan's office.	
It denied authorization for the mission and told him that he should turn the information provided by the confidential witness over to the Rwandan government which was planning the genocide!	Rwandan PLACE country="RW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16566130" id="Pl-12" latLong="2.000°S 30.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY",Rwanda PLACE country="RW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16566130" id="Pl-11" latLong="2.000°S 30.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
The result was that the information dried up and the genocide took place.	
Yup, good ole Kofi told this poor guy to give the secret info over to the very government that was planning the genocide.	
What a great guy he is isn't he.	
Or how about the ongoing prostitution that's going on in the Congo ?	Congo PLACE country="CD" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17794602" id="Pl-13" latLong="1.000°S 15.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
Now the report comes out today on the Oil for Food scandal.	
Yeah...this guy is such a good SG.	
Eff him.	
The article ends with the following: In an April 30, 2001, Washington Times column, Nat Hentoff noted that the media have devoted "scant mention" to the "plain fact that it was Mr. Annan, when he was head of the United Nation's peacekeeping office, who could have prevented the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis and their sympathizers in Rwanda in 1994."	Washington PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-14" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" predicative="true" state="US-DC" type="PPLC",Rwanda PLACE country="RW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16566130" id="Pl-11" latLong="2.000°S 30.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
It's true, Hentoff said, that the U.N. issued a report in 1999 that acknowledged, to some extent, its role in the killings.	
But for five and a half years, he noted, Annan "refused to accept any responsibility for the Rwandan holocaust until Mr. Gourevitch and others revealed that less than 5,000 U.N. troops could have stopped the killings if Mr. Annan had not closed his eyes."

It is astonishing that a journalist for NBC New would close her eyes to Annan's role.	
But that is what she was apparently paid to do.

 Pro-Terrorism Rally	
2005-03-08T18:14:00 Omar over at Iraq The Model posted a few thought on the rally today in Syria : I have noticed that some media sources are focusing on the size of the demonstrations and the number of the people who were gathered to attend at that time and place.	Syria PLACE country="SY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17451884" id="Pl-12" latLong="35.000°N 38.000°E" type="COUNTRY",Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
I think that the number of participants doesn't make a demonstration strong at all.	
The BBC says : The crowd dwarfed previous opposition protests urging Syrian troops to leave.

I think that the opposite is true as it proves how the tyrants in Syria and their allies in Lebanon are so scared of the growing sense of liberty among the people in Lebanon .	Syria PLACE country="SY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17451884" id="Pl-12" latLong="35.000°N 38.000°E" type="COUNTRY",Lebanon PLACE country="LB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19193726" id="Pl-18" latLong="33.833°N 35.833°E" type="COUNTRY"
The reason why I adopt this opinion is very simple; the opposition rallies were calling for liberty to their country and rejecting the Syrian interference which has infiltrated all important life sectors in Lebanon in the last 15 years.	Syria PLACE country="SY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17451884" id="Pl-12" latLong="35.000°N 38.000°E" type="COUNTRY",Lebanon PLACE country="LB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19193726" id="Pl-18" latLong="33.833°N 35.833°E" type="COUNTRY",Syrian PLACE country="SY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17451884" id="Pl-13" latLong="35.000°N 38.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY",country PLACE country="LB" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:19193726" id="Pl-21" latLong="33.833°N 35.833°E" type="COUNTRY"
While Hizbollah's rallies are allegedly opposing the " western foreign interference" which in fact doesn't exist!	
Moreover, these rallies are actually encouraging the Syrian interference (that's foreign interference, right?) in the interior affairs of Lebanon and condemning the decision of international community represented by resolution 1559.

Another point is that bringing too many people by buses doesn't mean that you're right.

But the truth is, and the people know it, Baath rule brought nothing but shame and humiliation.	
It destroyed the very moral and civil fabric of our fledgling republic.	
And the people know it.	
And the people know it.	
That's exactly the problem.	
The people know it.	
This is not the time of ignorance anymore.	
We know.	
We are informed.	
We may not the whole truth about what is happening all around in us, but we really don't need to.	
We just know enough not to be fooled by empty promises and gestures.	
We know enough to distinguish between victory and defeat, between a show of principles and a freak show.	
Even more weirder.

 A True Hero - Sgt Kasal Part III	
2005-03-12T11:25:00 Got a few updates on this story.	
First off Senor Lechero (a friend of his) has a post up about the injuries Sgt Kasal sustained and his recovery: The injuries to 1st Sgt Kasal's right leg were severe.	
5 or 6 rounds from an AK-47 completely shattered (read destroyed, obliterated, disintegrated) both bones about 6" below his knee.	
The doctor's at Bethesda were able to save his leg and set him on a course for recovery.	Bethesda PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-1" type="PPL"
That course consists of an incredibly painful devise ("far more painful than being shot") which is "transporting" his leg bone.	
In a previous update I said his leg was being "stretched", but that is not entirely correct.	
What is happening is this...... 1st Sgt Kasal's leg bones were sawed in half, in two locations (above and below the injury).	
The two sections of leg bone are being transported by an "Excursion" devise which has screws that actually move the bones inside Brad's leg.	
The device consists of 4 halos, and 16 pins, some 1 4" thick, protruding through his skin and muscle into his bones.	
The transporting which is taking place is closing the gap from the original injury while widening the gap from the doctor created injuries, which are filling in with naturally regenerating bone.	
This is being done to get his leg ready for a bone graft surgery.	
He still has a little over an inch to go, which will take a month or more to accomplish.	
The doctors expect Brad to walk again, but not run.	
Brad says..	
...."If says...	
..."If says....	
.."If says.....	
."If says......	
"If I can walk, I'll run:" I for one believe Brad.	
The doctor's can diagnose a body's condition, but not a man's will. 1st Sgt Kasal is a man of extremely strong willpower, and I'm betting on him being able to run again someday, and pass the Corp's PFT (physical fitness test) The story of how 1st Sgt.	
Kasal was injured is very interesting, and someday it will be told in it's entirety.	
Brad told me that he went into that building "because his marines were in there".	
One of "his marines" was Sgt.	
Norwood , whom President Bush honored at the State of the Union Address.	
Sgt. Norwood was killed in that building where such incredible damage was done to 1st.	
Sgt Kasal, PFC Nicoll, and 6 other brave US marines.	US PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" type="COUNTRY"
Also, NPR has some audio interviews with the photographer of the famous picture and more.	
And finally Lisa Hoffman wrote a excellent article entitled "Roster of American Combat Heroes in Iraq is Rich" which detailes a bit about Sgt Kasal and Sgt Peralta, whom I have blogged about extensively: Though most have won little note outside their own units and hometowns, dozens of GIs - many brand-new to adulthood - have distinguished themselves with extraordinary valor in what for many were their last moments of life.	Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
One was Sgt.	
Rafael Peralta, 25, of San Diego , a Mexican immigrant who joined the Marines the day after he got his "green card."

A platoon scout who didn't have to go on the dangerous Nov. 15 mission, Peralta volunteered to join a "stack" of five Marines hunting insurgents house-to-house in Fallujah .	Fallujah PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897741" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.356°N 43.783°E" state="AN" type="PPL"
Three enemy fighters waited behind a closed door.	
When Peralta opened it, he was hit in the head and chest by a close-up fusillade of AK-47 fire.	
His Marine mates fought on, until one of the insurgents rolled a grenade toward Peralta, who lay bleeding on the floor.	
To save his nearby comrades, Peralta reached for the explosive and tucked it under his stomach, where it exploded.	
He was the only Marine to die.	
"This champion of men made the split-second decision to sacrifice his life for his men," Julie Snyder, a Snohomish , Wash. , mother of a Marine saved that day, wrote in an online tribute to Peralta.	Wash.

"The words don't exist to describe what's in my heart for this man." ... So did 1st Sgt.	
Brad Kasal, 38, who led a half-dozen Marines into an insurgent-held house in Fallujah in November last year to rescue three wounded leathernecks trapped inside.	Fallujah PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897741" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.356°N 43.783°E" state="AN" type="PPL"
When the mission was over, Kasal had been shot seven times and punctured by 40 pieces of shrapnel, which he absorbed when he used his body to shelter an injured comrade from an enemy grenade.	
Kasal survived, as did all but one of the other Marines.

2005-03-12T16:46:00 Can you freakin believe this ? (hat tip The Jawa Report ): A terrorist group has published a do-it-yourself plan to make a dirty bomb on its Internet site.	
Named Alma'sadah Al-Jihadiah, the site is run by a group whose aim is to promote and propagate terror activities in the region.	
A member of the group, calling himself Abu Al-Harith Al-Sawahiri the Mujahid Sheikh, provides a step-by-step instruction of making a dirty bomb, starting from tear gas canisters to higher-grade bombs, including those using uranium, on the site.	
The member, whose expertise veers toward chemical warfare, shows a marked emphasis in making gas bombs.	
He introduces the subject by naming the different gases used for these purposes, and follows it up with their reaction with the elements, effects and their impact, before concluding by telling all where to buy them. ... At the end of his session, the writer, who asked his followers to go for jihad, received a comment from another writer asking him to give more details as they needed it to start making those gases in Iraq . "We need simple quick ways to make them, for us to quickly fight the Americans and the great traitor Allawi," said the comment.

The site has also issued a statement in the form of a "Fatwa" allowing and justifying the killing of foreigners in the country .	country PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-6" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
The statement entitled "Fighting the Foreigners", which is issued by a group based in Algeria and named Al-Jama'ah Al-Salafiyah (The Salafi Group), says that the Crusaders who invaded Islamic countries centuries ago have set up the Arab governments to be their eyes in the region.	Algeria PLACE country="DZ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:20336619" id="Pl-7" latLong="28.000°N 3.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
Therefore, the group argues, it is a must to kill the foreigners who are guarded by such governments.	
Internet Haganah has some more information plus some screenshots of the post: Getting back to the moron who posted the nuclear info, username ahmed_assalafil, we note that he posts using roman, not arabic, letters in a weird mix of Arabic and English.

 Acceptance of Terror	
2005-03-13T18:26:00 Bill over at The Fourth Rail has an excellent essay on how the MSM and the UN, even the leftist countries in Europe , are basically accepting terrorist organizations as legitimate forms of a political party: On the same day Palestinians protest in support of Hezbollah and Syria , the terrorist group Hamas has indicated it will participate in the scheduled upcoming Parliamentary elections . SIGNAL id="S-1" To the north SIGNAL in Lebanon , there is serious debate within Hezbollah about entering the Lebanese political process in light of Syria 's promised withdrawal.	 ,Syria PLACE country="SY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17451884" id="Pl-4" latLong="35.000°N 38.000°E" type="COUNTRY",Lebanon PLACE country="LB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19193726" id="Pl-6" latLong="33.833°N 35.833°E" type="COUNTRY",Lebanese PLACE country="LB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19193726" id="Pl-7" latLong="33.833°N 35.833°E" type="COUNTRY"
Syria has agreed to withdraw under the conditions set forth in UNSC Resolution 1559 , which has already begun . UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has indicated it is time to "recognize Hezbollah" after easily being duped by "the message on the placards they are using".	 ,Syria PLACE country="SY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17451884" id="Pl-4" latLong="35.000°N 38.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
This acceptance of blatantly terrorist groups as legitimate freedom movements is a cancerous tumor on the United Nations and the media.	 
Over three years after 9-11, the United Nations, despite their attempts to project strength in fighting terrorism , still cannot properly define the word "terrorist" , waffling over the issue of whether the murder of innocent civilians are terrorist acts.	 
The media routinely obscures the lines between terrorism and legitimate resistance, as the recent article by Daniel Okrent of The New York Times demonstrates . ... The decision to sidestep the obvious to satisfy the need to avoid confrontation does not bring peace, but only delays the eventual conflict as the predators of Hamas and Hezbollah exploit the inherent weakness of the internationals and the media.	 ,New York PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-8" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="NY" type="PPL"

Wtf is this?	 
This is a terrorist organization plain and simple.	 
This is the organization that bombed our Marine barracks in 1983, took Americans hostage throughout the 80's and now they should be considered a legitimate organization?

2005-03-28T17:25:00 You may remember Pablo Paredes from an earlier posting of mine.	
He is the coward who after volunteering for the Navy decided he doesn't want to serve in Iraq so he went AWOL all the while getting as much press as possible from his Socialist buddies.	Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
Well, he was " surprised " yesterday when he was formally charged with AWOL and Missing A Movement (what took them so long?): Petty Officer 3rd Class Pablo E. Paredes decided to protest the Iraq war by not sailing with his ship when it left San Diego Harbor on Dec. 6.	Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
Yesterday, the Navy decided to charge Paredes, 23, with being absent without leave and missing movement, charges that could send him to military prison for as long as a year and limit his employment options.	
The action by the Navy surprised Paredes, who made headlines and drew supporters and critics with his stance.	
"I showed up at the base expecting to hear whether the local Navy command had approved my conscientious objector status.	
Instead I was read the charges against," said Paredes, who is on temporary duty at Naval Base San Diego .	
This guy is in for an even bigger surprise once he gets his just deserts.	
Hopefully he rots in prison for the maximum which is one year in jail . Plus tack on forfeiture of pay, reduction in rank and a bad-conduct discharge.	
Guess he can get a job as a secretary for A.N.S.W.E.R. and his other buddies, doubt many will be hiring a shitbird who has a Big Chicken Dinner on his record.	
Thanks to Citizen Smash on the heads up and for doing such a great job of holding this coward accountable.

 The Bias In The MSM	
2005-04-04T19:13:00 Great article in the Investors Business Daily today about the bias in the MSM: The attention given to any event that shows the U.S. in a bad light, and the inattention paid to news that makes U.S. mistakes pale by comparison, never ceases to amaze.

We'll probably never hear the end of that.	
Nor was it a case of a woman journalist -- like Giuliana Sgrena of the communist newspaper Il Manifesto -- being fired on as her limousine ran an American checkpoint in Baghdad .

Still, the Canadian death in Iran involved both a prisoner and a female journalist, and you tell us which was most "horrific."

The journalist was Zahra Kazemi, 54, a freelancer of Iranian origin who had the guts -- or just the professionalism -- to take photos outside a Tehran prison during student-led protest against the ruling theocracy.

For this, she was arrested.	
Just days later, Kazemi was taken -- unconscious, with bruises all over her body -- to a military hospital . Prison officials said she was suffering digestive problems and had vomited blood.	
The hospital doctor who examined her, and who has since won asylum, told reporters last week in Canada that the blood Kazemi vomited had poured down her throat from a smashed nose.	Canada PLACE country="CA" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19437937" id="Pl-6" latLong="60.000°N 96.000°W" type="COUNTRY"
That wasn't all.	
The doctor, Shahram Azam, noticed injuries to her entire body that could only have been caused by torture and rape.	
They included a skull fracture, two broken fingers, missing fingernails and a crushed big toe.	
There were also deep scratches on the neck and evidence of flogging on the legs and back.	
Azam said that as a male doctor in a military hospital, he was barred from examining a woman's genitals.	
But he said the nurse who did so told him of "brutal damage."	
Iranian officials have said Kazemi died after she went on a hunger strike, fainted and struck her head as she fell.

Other authorities at various times have acknowledged that she was killed by state security officials.	
But the official explanation remains unchanged.	
Case -- and, no doubt, news coverage -- closed.	
Now THIS journalist was assassinated, unlike Sgrena....not only that, she was REALLY tortured, unlike those poor widdle terrorists in Abu Ghraib who were forced to wear womens panties over their heads.

 The Corrupt UN	
2005-04-06T12:51:00 Another reason why this organization should be dismantled: (hat tip The Captain ) The United Nations says it is looking into allegations that a UN document contained false information that caused instability in war-torn central Africa .	 
A former UN employee, the American intelligence analyst William Church, told the BBC the details were added to a public UN report by other UN staff.	 ,American PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
The report stated Rwanda mounted a military incursion against neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo last year.	 ,Democratic Republic of Congo PLACE country="CD" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17937007" id="Pl-10" latLong="0.000°N 25.000°E" type="COUNTRY",Rwanda PLACE country="RW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16566130" id="Pl-9" latLong="2.000°S 30.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
This false allegation endangered the peace process in DR Congo , he says.	 ,DR Congo PLACE country="CD" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17937007" id="Pl-14" latLong="0.000°N 25.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
The stakes could not be higher.	 
The war in DR Congo , which has spread throughout central Africa , is one of the deadliest of our generation.	 ,DR Congo PLACE country="CD" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17937007" id="Pl-14" latLong="0.000°N 25.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
Over the past decade, four million people have died as a result of it.	 
The UN has now imposed an arms embargo on DR Congo .	 ,DR Congo PLACE country="CD" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17937007" id="Pl-14" latLong="0.000°N 25.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
A UN panel investigating that embargo reported in January that DR Congo 's neighbour, Rwanda , had violated it by mounting a military incursion.	 ,DR Congo PLACE country="CD" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17937007" id="Pl-14" latLong="0.000°N 25.000°E" type="COUNTRY",Rwanda PLACE country="RW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16566130" id="Pl-9" latLong="2.000°S 30.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
But a dissenting member of the UN panel, William Church, has now told the BBC that the Rwandan invasion was a false claim added by other panel members who had come under pressure from un-named sources.	 ,Rwandan PLACE country="RW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16566130" id="Pl-8" latLong="2.000°S 30.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY",Rwanda PLACE country="RW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16566130" id="Pl-9" latLong="2.000°S 30.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
The chair of the UN investigation, the Algerian diplomat Abdulahi Baali, has told the BBC that he is now looking into what he called "serious allegations".	 ,Algerian PLACE country="DZ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:20336619" id="Pl-15" latLong="28.000°N 3.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
All this matters because the UN has been entrusted with trying to bring peace to central Africa .	 
If there are disputes between UN employees about something as basic as one country invading another, that trust may be brought into question.	 
The Rwanda invasion became the catalyst for the UN to remain there and eventually exploit the young girls for prostitution.	 ,Rwanda PLACE country="RW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16566130" id="Pl-9" latLong="2.000°S 30.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
If this invasion turns out to be fake then it could turn out to be another reason why this corrupt organization should be dismantled top to bottom and thrown in the sewer.	 
UPDATE 4 9 05 2030HRS Received the following today from an Anonymous user: This is an update from William Church.	 
I have reviewed my analysis with the governments of UK US EU and Netherlands and received comments like the evidence is credible.	 ,US PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-16" type="COUNTRY",UK PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-17" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY",Netherlands PLACE country="NL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17850115" id="Pl-18" latLong="52.500°N 5.750°E" type="COUNTRY"
I alerted the UN of this problem two months before the report was published.	 
They did nothing to vet the report.	 
The UN is now responding with a slander campaign against me.	 
One journalist told me they labeled me a troublemaker and said I was only doing this because I did not like the Experts and there was no proof.	 
The UN has no intention of investigating this claim.	 
They are betting it will die down and it will be business as usual.

I know my husband said he thinks -- that uh -- Colin Powell should -- but I don't think he will.

Sara Mhm.	
Suzanne um -- I really don't think that Hillary Clinton -- would be -- a good choice for the Democrats.

Suzanne um I don't think Barak Obama would be a very good choice for the Democrats.

Sara um -- trying to think who else -- Arnold Schwarzenegger I don't think -- well he's not qualified anyway, but Suzanne Well, they might change something, you know, between now and then.

We have, you know, I -- team managers, training managers.	
It's a very big company.	
Yeah, and I think that the atmosphere is very good, I Bill Right.	
Alexander Yeah.	
Bill Well, I think that's important to to have a good atmosphere and also, uh, uh, i- know who who really is in charge, uh, you know, and and know who you have to answer to.	
Because sometimes, y- I I I did I years ago I had a company that was, uh, it was, uh, I was a subs- s- captive sub-contractor for making packaging material.	
And, um, there were a lot of salesmen in the company, they had a tendency to, you know, there was there was, uh, a chain of command, you might say.	
You know, there was, uh, the person that was the, uh, head of the organization.	
But, all the salesmen -- used to come around and give orders, too, you know.	
So it made it kind of difficult for the m- for my employees, because they would the salesmen would be coming out, uh, uh, without consulting with the one that was in charge.	
They would just be coming out and giving orders when they should already went through him.	
So it made it difficult.	
So I I I think it's really important to h- have that really clear.	
That that there's some organized way to deal with, uh, problems and orders and things like that, and if there is a problem, then -- you go to the person who's in charge and -- then they can handle it.	
So, that was -- that that's just a you know, a -- previous, uh, type of work that I had.	
And I and tha- I think that's what they wanted us to talk about, too, right?	
Alexander Yeah.	
Yeah, that's that's that's I think it's just basically, is (()) one of the things I perceive is if- what kind of, you know, environment is it, and is it inviting is it, you know, all that they I guess that's what they're aiming at.	
You know, it's not a place where everybody trying to give instruction and everybody trying to do, you know.	
Uh, but I for my job is i- i- -- we have us a very diverse feel.	
We have a lot of people who are from different country, and, you know, and -- I think they are pretty much accepting, and I, you know, I- bas- basically you- you can promote yourself if you do a good job, I mean, they don't pick and choose, you know.	
Bill Right.	
Alexander It's a very -- environment that allows you to grow in.	
And I think they thinks I rightfully don't, if -- like if I have a problem, like, I'll freshly go to my team lead or the supervisor and she takes it to her boss, and, you know, the boss takes it to the next level and, you know, something like that.	
Bill Right.	
Yeah, but that -- I feel like that that's very important.	
Uh, for a company to be well-run, it has to have, uh, a c- it's t- has to be able to send a clear message -- as to how to handle problems and who who is the one that's uh, uh, indicated for -- for those problems -- to handle.	
And and people -- those in the company need to be um instructed -- to know wh- where their relative place is in the company.	
So that they they don't overstep their bounds.	
Alexander Yeah.	
Bill Because when that happens, and it that makes, uh, that creates problems for the employees.	
It makes them discontent.	
I mean, if they if they can be, eh, um, you know, jumped on arbitrarily by just about anybody, then pretty soon, you know, they're they're they're not going to be content at all, they're just going to wonder, well when when's the next hit going to come, you know.	
When's somebody else going to jump on me?

I hadn't I hadn't really thought about it.	
I -- Colin Powell didn't surprise me.	
Ashcroft surprised me a little bit um but um I sort of started to think he might step down because evidently he was being he was considered somewhat of a lightning rod for um you know some of his more controversial stands and stuff so.

I mean do you think Sherri Kellogg, the Kellogg guy.

The the police kind of changed their tactics and, because there was a lot of -- oh -- run down areas, and a lot of crime and they, you know -- got -- cleaned it up, and and -- they passed some laws that said, you know, you couldn't, I think it was like, um -- you know, like homeless people that -- carrying -- uh -- you know, shopping carts, or something like that, and it sounds -- small -- to outlaw that.	
But they outlawed that because they said a lot of people were stealing stuff.	
They'd stick them in the shopping carts and push them down the road.	
You wouldn't know, oh, they're just a homeless person.	
Well they cut that out and they found out -- it cut down on the theft.	
Uh -- I guess people -- hide them in their basket and -- or taking something and then stick in their basket and the police never -- you know, bothered them.	
Well, the homeless people -- I guess, they need their shopping cart, so they kind of went elsewhere, so -- um -- I mean it's a small thing, but it was, they just figured out, they were -- you know, uh -- learning from experience on what they need to do in the -- city and -- I think he would be a good -- candidate for the Homeland Security, running that.	city PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-8" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="US-NY" type="PPL"

Hey shoot, you got more sense than I do.	
Christina Okay, I -- have been following the trial, I don't know why, ever since this whole thing happened.	
I am a stay at home mom, so I get to watch the ~TV more often, and I -- you know have been fo- -- watching all these forensic pathologists, Dr. Henry Lee.	
You know, and and what I see is that there is no physical evidence that he did it.	
And yeah, it sounds like he did do it because he dyed his hair, was trying to get away, and the anchor and a boat.	
But there's -- -- I for some reason, deep down in my heart, don't believe he did it.	
And you know and I think the media made him guilty, and I think -- it's like you know, I mean you saw what happened outside the courtroom , I don't know if you did or not, see how they were cheering on.	courtroom PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-14" nonLocUse="true" state="US-CA" type="FAC"
I don't think he's guilty and, I hope he doesn't get the death penalty.

I I just don't think he's guilty.	
I think he's wrong, what he did, everything, he cheated on his wife, that's so wrong, but -- that doesn't make him a murderer, he's just a cheater, he's just a -- you know, like one hundred ten percent you know eighteen karat -- asshole, like i- Mar- Mark Geragos called him.	
Greg Yeah.	
Christina How about you?	
You probably think he's guilty, or Greg Well -- Yeah, no I, I think, I think ((the guy's)) definitely guilty uh Just based on, I haven't followed it all that closely, although you can't help but follow it closely because there's so much crap on the news.	
Christina Mhm.	
Greg But uh no i- the -- uh the I think well first of all, you know I agree with you, I think cheating on your wife's pretty low.	
But I think what happened i- it's living the b- uh living large.	
You could tell both of them uh you look some of the things they had, you know, he had a few bucks or so.	
(()) finish, things were getting him down, uh you know, you know how it is, day after day though -- M- marriage isn't all that wonderful.	
Christina Right.	
Greg Eh, you know and I don't think he had faced that, and plus, you know, a lot of the neat stuff from the outside, and particularly Amber Frey, who I don't particularly think is neat, but it was something that uh you know he went after Christina Mhm.	
Greg and so uh he figured, well -- these will, these things would get rid of her I guess.	
I don't, I don't know why like his uh, the wife's or the mother said divorce is an option I think.

I know, that's very powerful.	
Not, you know, not murder and, oh, I mean, I don't know.

He was screwed up, you know, a despicable human being and he, just -- You know, the easy way out.	
This'll work, I guarantee I'm too damn smart.

Kelly keep like -- uh, the jury from watching ~TV and the media and stuff.	
But I guess now ((it's, uh)) -- pretty much impossible -- to do.	
Hillary I i don't know.	
I never really got the whole -- watching it on ~TV and and getting into the whole -- mystery of it because, in the end, the woman's dead and so is her child and -- and -- there's -- really no way of changing that I guess.	
Kelly Yeah, uh, I think it's kind of strange how it was so publicized.	
Like I'm just, seriously, like I don't, like I try not to watch, like -- too much, like Hillary You can't help it sometimes.	
Kelly Yeah I know.	
But it just amazes me that, uh, I think it's ridiculous how publicized -- how much publicity it got because -- I mean there's like human rights violations going on all around the world.

Jean Mohammed, calling from New York .	New York PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-4" state="US-NY"
Glad to meet you.	
Well, the topic is interesting, but they've been having this one for three days.	
I don't know why they're so obsessed with it.	
Mohammed Seems like it's a weekend, or they want to get as much as they can feedback from people.	
Jean I guess so, Yes.	
Mohammed And so what do you think was- Jean I I didn't actually -- watch the trial very much, uh th- in fact, I didn't watch the trial at all.	
Mohammed Mhm.	
Jean I read about it in the newspaper and things like that.	
Um, I do think from all the, uh, things that I have heard that he -- had to be guilty with all the evidence that they had, but um, I don't really know why, uh, if everybody was so, sort of, obsessed about it when we've got so much other -- things going on in the world that, uh, seem to me much more important, but um.	
Perhaps it was because he seemed, uh, a very human kind of person and, and you cou- you couldn't really understand why he would want to do something about that.	
I- I think his motive must have been to be with his new girlfriend, but uh- -- kill his own first child that way is extraordinary.	
What do you think?	
Mohamed?	
Mohammed Yeah.	
Jean And what do you- What do you think about it?	
Mohammed Being very frankly, I was not, uh, following the case at all even uh uh television, or uh reading, but from what I can observe,that it seems, eh, it has been talking -- -- taking too long time.	
Like one year almost, now.	
It was- Jean When you what?	
Mohammed It was -- taking so much time.	
Long time.	
Jean Yes.	
Mohammed The case is almost one year.	
Like last, uh, Christmas if I'm not, uh, recalling my memory.	
So for one year, it's really a good time.	
Hu- So I'm asking myself why it took such a long Jean Hm.	
Mohammed It may be because -- it's quite important, or so there is so many everything's, I mean, it's, it's a really different case.	
But, the quo- the nice quotient is about the media.	
But the media have biased in this, Jean Yes.	
Mohammed or not?	
I believe that media is a very good, uh, I mean, uh, way to give us all the opportunity to understand and see.	
I mean without the media, you and I, how we will be knowing?	
Jean No, exactly.	
Do you think they were biased in in -- favor of him, or in favor Mohammed I- -- No, I don't think so.	
Jean No, I didn't think so either from what I heard.	
Mohammed Maybe -- sometimes in- in- in- in other issues they- they may be biased, but in this issue they were just -- covering what's happening, Jean Yes.	
Mohammed and, uh, they give us the picture.	
It was a camera -- to give you the view.	
I don't think they were biased in this case here.	
Jean Yes.	
No. Mohammed And, uh, what do you think will happen next?	
Jean Well, uh they're coming up to the sentencing, and I heard yesterday or read in the newspaper or something that his brother -- I guess it was on the television.	
In the news, his brother was appealing -- for them to to sentence him to -- to prison for life rather than the death penalty, because -- he said he's a very good listener and he cares about people, and and he might be able to help a lot of people in prison.	
I don't know whether that is true or not.	
I know that he had done a lot of volunteer things before, and that was the one things that made me wonder there was any possible chance that it could have been somebody else who did it.	
I think given such as I have heard, even though like you, I did not follow the case day by day or anything like that, I don't quite see how he could not be guilty if they've got so much that appears to point to him.	
And what would be the motive for anybody trying to -- to get him if it wasn't Mohammed Yeah.

Gandhi Okay, Mark.	
Uh, I think it's fresh topic for tonight.	
Marco Yeah, yeah.	
Good topic.	
It's a good topic.	
Gandhi So what do you think?	
Marco Well, um, I would- I would have to start- -- I would have to start, generally, in stating- -- stating what I think is the problem and -- -with the Middle East and what- For me, one of the major problems is the fact that -- the -- United States government gives so much aid to the state of Israel .	United States PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-14" type="COUNTRY",Israel PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-6" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY"
In which, the state of Israel buys -- many expensive military weapons, ah, which is used to -- oppress and -- to kill a lot of Palestinians.	Palestinian PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-8" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY",Israel PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-6" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY"
So, for me, that's -- the- that's essentially the root of the problem.	
And, um, Yasser Arafat was kind of in a difficult position, because you have these, um, incredibly -- oppressed and in some ways imprisoned, uh, Palestinians, and if -- Arafat hadn't, um, tried to stand up -- and help them and- and fight for their rights, then -- m- they wouldn't have respected Arafat, but then again, you know, he couldn't be too friendly with the West, um, and, um, and so he did the best he could, I think.	Palestinian PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-8" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
It's a difficult -- leadership role.	
Gandhi Mhm.	
Marco Yeah.	
Um, what do- Well, how about you?	
Gandhi I think, yeah, more or less, I c- I agree with what you said.	
It's almost, this is my view as well.	
And the question is, what next?	
I mean, some idea -- from Israeli side, they were saying -- he was a problem, and if he goes, everything will be quite easy.	Israel PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-6" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY",Israeli PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-3" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
Marco Yeah.	
Gandhi Fine.	
Now he's not in anymore.	
Marco Yeah.	
Gandhi So, let us wait and see.	
Hope.	
If he was a problem himself, hope -uh, the coming one -- will be in a good -- position to negotiate with the other side, Israel , and then -- peace can be achieved.	Israel PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-6" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY"
Marco Yeah.	
Gandhi Uh, we have to wait and see, but, uh, it seems it's not easy.	
Marco But, I, eh, I get the feeling that- -- It's almost- -- The peace process- We can't put it on -- the ro- or the- -- the whole responsibility of the pre- -- peace process can't be the leader of -- a- -- a group that is- -- I don't know, in my view, has -- not ver- not very many resources to fight- -- to fight this -- battle that -- their trying to fight against -- a government that has taken away a lot of their land, that, you know, doesn't allow them to really move around in their own country . So, unless that -- stops, the, um, the leader of the Palestinians -- really can't do too much -- to further the peace process, because -- there are -- a lot of bad things happening to the people -- of that -- leader.

Gandhi That's correct, as well.	
Marco Yeah, so it's- -- it's kind of, it's- -- it seems like the, um, the media, at least in the United States , is -- putting all of this -- focus and responsibility on the leader of the Palestinians, as if it was Gandhi Marco Arafat's fault that any of- -- any of the violence was caused.	United States PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-14" type="COUNTRY",Palestinian PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-8" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"

Um, yeah.	
Gandhi Yes.	
That's absolutely correct.

Sue Yeah.	
Right, I knew that.	
Ben But, you know, I- I kind of agreed with that Arafat thing, though.

Sue Well, he- -- he did but I think he really failed miserably, in my opinion, when he, um, refused to sign that treaty that was originally set up because it was a wonderful -- option and it really could've re- done some wonderful things for his people and I think he really did them a disservice by not taking care of it at that time.	
Ben Uh-huh.	
Uh-huh.	
Yeah, what was the treaty?	
I'm not familiar with it.	
Sue Well, um, where they were going to, uh, give them, like, ninety-six percent of the Ga- of- of Gaza and he said that he wanted all hundred percent.	Gaza PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19202844" id="Pl-13" latLong="31.417°N 34.333°E" state="PS-GZ" type="CIVIL"
And so he refused to sign it.	
It was just an- an incredible faux pas on his part, from my opinion.	
Ben Oh.	
Yeah.	
Yeah, y- it's- it's -- you have to sometimes take a little bit less than you want, you know, uh, an- and ninety-six percent is a big percentage, you know.

Um, it was really quite unfortunate that- that he -- that he was not willing to, um, step forward -- to do- do what was really in the best interests of his people.	
Ben Sometimes- sometimes I th- I think it's hard when- when you're the- the first leader, or the George Washington of something, to see things other than in black and white.	
You know, or maybe he didn't have the gift of- of nuance that would've helped him to- -- to take that right step, uh, you know, the- -- the -- his people suffer so terribly and maybe, you know, it could have been better if he had signed that, huh.	
Sue I really think so.	
I really, truly do and now it's a- a situation where, with his passing, um, I think there's a real, um, new opening, a new possibility for- -- some extremely positive steps to come forward out of this -- I do think that the United States -- will probably be requested to be involved in the negotiation process and I understand that, I me- uh, because, um, I think -- both sides -- have a trust in the United States that make it- Ben And we've ha- we have a history, uh, Clinton and Carter w- worked over there -- -try to get some peace going.

That's just my opinion.	
But i- it seems like that- that was always a problem for him.	
Hm.	
Rainia Yeah.	
Um, I'm not sure myself uh how good a leader he was.	
I I -- it's hard to get the truth w- when the -- when the there's so many uh slanted uh -- information Paul Yeah.

That- that's interesting, too, because -- cutting Yasser Arafat out of the whole thing was- -- was really -- George Bush's decision.

United States PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-23" type="COUNTRY",Israel PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-9" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY"
The -- unfortunately what happens right now- -- The -- for example, which is -- little bit toward it's- it's interest.	
For example, when there was, uh, like, a -- decision against Iraq , the United States -- went directly -- to Iraq to -- -- for, eh, uh, an invasion -- and -- for -- whatever reasons- -- she even was out, uh, putting any attention to the United Nations, uh, like, uh, approval.	United States PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-23" type="COUNTRY",Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-25" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
She did wha- what she want.	
But, eh, eh, for Israeli , Palestinian conflict there's a lot of decisions that has to be -- applied but until now -- she didn't put any pressure, eh, toward ((this and)) and I believe this policy has been, uh, this kind of policy, eh, um, eh, became more and more during -- eh, during, uh, eh, Bush -- -- President Bush time.	Palestinian PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-11" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY",Israel PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-9" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY",Israeli PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-4" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY"
For example, before, eh, during Clinton, I believe at that time -- Clinton was trying hard -- to solve this problem and I believe at that time, if you remember, um, Yasser Arafat -- and, uh, the prime minister of Israel , his name was Barak, they met together in the White House -- and -- they almost came to an agreement -- to solve this problem -- and during Clinton, eh, period -- they had, uh, this ((Oslo)) a- eh, agreement.	White House PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532723" id="Pl-161" latLong="38.898°N 77.037°W" state="US-DC" type="FAC",Israel PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-9" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY"
Most of the big problems between the two parties, they negotiated everything almost and there is -- there were, like, final steps that have to be solved.	
But, uh, I think if there was, like, the, um, the same policy has to be followed after Clinton.	
I think -- everything would- -- -finished then- -- the -- I think United States -- went to another direction and, eh, they forgot about this problem right now.	United States PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-23" type="COUNTRY"
Mark Yeah, I g- eh, see, I don't, Ali Mark um, when- when policy is set by one -- -- by one president -- towards- towards one thing, it's usually -- followed through, if there is something to follow through, by the -- next president in turn.	
He is more or less obligated -- to continue, uh, the process that was already started -- but -- I think -- Bush's -- agenda -- is not -- towards that right now.	
That is not his priority, I don't think.	
Ali Yeah, I think so, yes.	
Mark And, eh, uh, although, you know, it's been a long time -- that -- i- they have both -- b- both Israel and Palestine , they both need a -- they both need their own country -- and- Ali That's, uh, true because, uh, Mark an- -- eh, y- Ali in the United Nations they have established -- eh, they made this decision already.

Ali and another one for Israeli but, uh, Mark I- I- I agree a hundred percent, uh, Ali because, eh, i- Mark eh, but to get so involved in it.

I think, the people, uh, the people that are in charge, the- eh, the people that run the governments there -- do need to sit down an- and- and be in touch with each other and if they need a mediator or something like that, that- Ali Which is played by U- United States .

Paul Nice to meet you, too.	
Ken Thank you.	
Have yo- how so, how do you feel about this Scott Peterson trial and all the publicity they're putting into it, and Paul Well, I -- I think it -- gets so much publicity because this -- this guy came out and -- claimed his wife was missing Ken Right.	
Paul and then, uh, his double life came came into view, and I I think that was Ken Right.	
Paul kind of fascinating, Ken Uh, with the with the girlfriend?	
Paul for -- Yeah.	
Ken Okay.	
Paul For a lot of folks.	
Ken Okay, I guess I can agree with that, also, um, yeah.	
Paul I mean, he's he's not really a celebrity like ~OJ was, or Ken Yeah, well, I that's what I was g- my next question was, that was another big criminal criminal, uh, trial, Paul or -- Yeah.	
Ken you know, and they -- that went on for months and months and months and then, I guess the next one that we'll be getting is the Michael Jackson thing.	
Paul Yeah, Michael Jackson and and Robert Blake, Ken Yeah, Robert Blake, Robert Blake.	
Paul and, uh Ken He's out right now, isn't he, or is still in jail?	
Paul I'm I'm not sure.

Ken Oh, that's Baretta.	
He's he's in jail.	
Paul Baretta.

These guys, I don't know.	
Paul Robert Blake doesn't seem like he's all there.	
Ken Yeah, well.	
Paul I I don't know what's going to happen in that one.	
Ken But he needs that parakeet with him or something.	
Remember the parakeet in the show?	
Yeah, I Paul That's right.	
I forgot about that.	
Yeah.	
Ken uh, Gilligan's Island , all this good stuff.

Ken I mean, it was great stuff.	
Paul Baretta.	
They -- Baretta had a really good theme song, too.	
Ken Yeah, yeah.	
Yeah, I like that song.	
I like that song, yeah.	
But with this Peterson guy -- he looks so cool and reserved but, uh, it's like nothing's phasing him, and Paul I know.	
Even when they Ken Do you think he did it?	
Paul when they read the verdict he he didn't even flinch, didn't even blink.	
Ken No.	
Uh, do you think he did it?	
Paul I went, wow, that's kind of weird.	
Ken Yeah.	
Paul Well, i- it makes me think that he probably did it.	
Ken Eh, he, eh, w- it seemed like he covered his tracks, though, I mean, they have no evidence other than the bodies that they found.	
Paul Yeah.	
Ken So, it's crazy, but, they're saying where they're going to put him th eh, in the same prison next to Charles Manson or something like that.	
That's, like, really crazy.	
Yeah, so they can be buddies or something, I don't know.	
Paul ((But)) Ken But I don't think he's going to last in jail if he goes to jail, I mean.	
They talking abou- -- how do you feel about this death penalty thing?	
Paul Well, jeez, I I don't know.	
Ken Eh, I mean, I don't thin- I mean, I I I don't think that he should suffer that, you know, I think he should, um, I don't think that he should suffer that.	
Paul Yeah.	
Well, if if he does live and he is in prison, Ken Mhm.	
Paul he'll probably get some wacky woman -- who wants to marry him, Ken Oh yeah.	
Oh yeah.	
Yeah, that Paul get married two or three times in there.

And, um, I think he s- m- was meeting women in the jail like that, too, when he was there, but he just got out of doing fifteen years and, you know, he was just, eh, Central Park , he had, uh, well, rough sex or something, with a woman in the park and they said he strangled her, or Paul Oh, sure, the preppy guy.

Winnette Yeah?	
Irvin All right.	
Uh, what do you know about this Scott -- Peterson trial?	
I don't know much about it, to be honest with you.	
Winnette Oh this is funny because I just, one of my calls the other day was regarding this.	
Irvin Really?	
Winnette So uh uh they're act- -- actually that's getting a few different questions and -- actually the gentleman I got the other day -- hadn't even heard about it.	
Um, Irvin Oh really?	
Winnette Well um, I've been following it pretty closely.	
Um, I guess because of -- you know it being a mother and -- being pregnant for a baby.	
Irvin Oh, uh-huh.	
Winnette Um, kind of hit more to -- I you know to home.	
Um, So you -- how much of it have you followed?	
Did, did you -- follow any of it at all when it was on in the news or in the papers or anything?	
Irvin Hardly any of it at all, because -- um -- for one thing -- I do not have a ~TV or a radio and I don't get a daily newspaper.	
We get Winnette Oh wow.	
Irvin we get a weekly newspaper.	
Winnette Okay.	
Um, well I'll I don't get any newspapers at the house, but -- I listen to the radio every morning on my way to work and Irvin Oh yeah?	
Winnette and uh -- when it first happened it was -- pretty publicized on every radio station um -- it come across -- on the news and we keep our ~TV on at my work, because we have a customer waiting area, so Irvin Oh, uh-huh.	
Winnette um actually one of our employees had wa- watched ((happening)) -- so from that point on we kind of -- talked a lot about it at work and Irvin How long ago was it?	
Winnette different things.	
Um, it was a year -- almost a year ago.	
Over a year ago?	
Because it was just before Christmas -- that it happened.	
Irvin Over a year ago.	
Winnette Yeah.	
Um, I'm thinking -- I don't know, November, December, I'm not sure exactly.	
But I know it was just before Christmas -- when they had uh -- it had happened, because she was missing during Christmas and then they had found her body.	
And they -- they found the baby as well.	
Irvin Terrible.	
Winnette Um, so when they found the baby, the baby of course had been -- they don't know if the baby was born, through delivery, or -- if maybe from um -- the corpse I guess Irvin So the baby was separate.	
Winnette maybe extracted it.	
Um, actually she was pregnant for the baby.	
Irvin But the baby was separate from the body when he found it?	
Winnette Yes.	
Yep.	
Um, I don't know if ma- I you know I don't know the whole story for sure, but -- um -- he had -- you know, obviously -- denied that he was involved anything to do with it.	
Then they found out that he was having an affair on her.	
And -- then of course when they were investigating him -- he tried running.	
Dyed his hair and -- grew out a mustache and -- they caught him trying to run with -- quite a bit of cash.	
Irvin Wow.	
Winnette So I mean, Irvin (()) Winnette he's -- in all honesty been guilty all along the way but Irvin Uh-huh.	
Winnette of course you know they've got to give him that reasonable doubt.	
Irvin Uh-huh.	
So is he is he still um -- in prison now?	
Winnette Yeah.	
And they're making the determination if -- in fact he will get the death penalty, or life in prison.	
So that's what's is up in the air right now.	
Irvin What state is this in?	
Winnette California .	California PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780778" id="Pl-6" latLong="37.250°N 119.750°W" state="US-CA" type="CIVIL"

Winnette And -- um -- I know I had, it was supposed to have be deliberated on -- the twenty-second of November, but they had an issue happen with -- one of the jurors -- so it's postponed everything.	
But, actually they were trying to pass a law, and I don't know if it ever did take into effect, that if in fact a mother was killed, and pregnant, um -- for there to be a double murder charge.	
Irvin Oh, uh-huh.	
Winnette And -- they were in fact trying to enforce the death penalty on that charge if they were -- found guilty on both charges.	
Irvin Uh-huh.	
Winnette And -- so it's kind of up in the air now -- because he -- I believe he got first degree murder and -- um and then got manslaughter on the baby.	
So he didn't get both first degree murders.	
Irvin What's the difference?	
Winnette Where -- Um, I guess because he didn't murder the baby directly.	
Irvin Oh.	
Winnette I'm thinking maybe was the difference.	
And because of the the charge on the baby, they couldn't automatically give him the death penalty, but -- obviously there's enough -- um, complaints or whatever Irvin What was his excuse for doing something horrible like that?	
Winnette and -- well he still denies everything.	
He has never admitted Irvin ((Still does)) Winnette to do it.	
um -- But the only thing they can figure is that maybe -- he wanted back into the bachelor life, and didn't want to be a father, didn't want to be tied down with a wife and child Irvin So he didn't have any other children?	
Winnette that was -- No, that was going to be their first.	
And actually I don't even think they were married that long, maybe a year or two.

Salford Exactly.

Salford Uh-huh.	
I see.	
I see.	
Christina You know, it's travel and it was like a nine hour flight.	
Salford Right, that's a pretty long flight.	
Christina Mhm.	
But, like, now, and I know if I ever do get back on a plane like I will, you know, the longer you're not on a plane -- I haven't been on a plane for actually four years, the last time I was on a plane.	
Yeah, so it made me really nervous.	
Salford Oh, it's been a while then.	
We we -- Yeah, I see.	
Well, th- we tend to take vacations.	
I -- we work hard, so we're a working family and I just believe in getting up and going away, especially down to the Caribbean and and that sort of a thing and.	
.. and..

Uh-huh.	
Salford I'm on the phone, I'm sorry.	
So... Christina I'm on the phone, I'm going to get paid for this right now.	
Salford Um, yeah, eh, exactly we get paid for this so I..	
. Christina Yeah.	
Salford So it's, um, Christina Um, yeah.	
Salford i- it- i- it -- I- I think it's necessary, obviously because, you know, there're enemies out there, um.	
Christina Yeah.	
Salford But some of it, I don't know if it gets too -- maybe it's just a little bit too much, um.	
Christina Mhm.	
Salford To me anyway.	
I- I- I guess -- I guess it's necessary but I- I think some of it is just too much.	
Um.	
Christina Yeah.	
Salford That's how I feel.	
Christina Right.	
Salford I mean, I think other people I think -- I think most people want it to be as strenuous a- and as difficult as it is to board an airplane, but i- in -- I don't know.	
It's a touchy -- I don't think it's a touchy issue.	
I guess it depends on how- how you feel about it.	
I- I know n- -- I know one thing.	
I think the cockpit, I think that was the most important thing that they could've done, restricting the cockpit -- the cockpit.	
Christina Mhm.	
Yeah.	
Salford Cockpit.	
I think that alone -- I think that alone should should.	
.. should..	
. should...	
And the fact that th- there're air marshals now on board.	
Christina Are they really?	
There are now marshals?	
Yeah, mhm.	
On most air- ... Salford um Yeah.	
Yeah, oh, I mean, those guys are -- yeah, and I think they gave them the okay to also, uh, to go on board with weapons.	
Christina Mos- most airlines or almost all?	
Salford Most airlines I I think -- most airlines.	
Not on every flight, though.	
Christina Really?	
No?	
Salford I think they pick and choose.	
Christina They pick and choose.	
Salford Eh, I would imagine it's probably more on international flights than it is domestic.	
I mean, because they think terrorists is coming in, not going out.	
But... Christina Uh-huh.	
Right. Right.	
Salford I I I don't know.	
I think it's kind of dangerous to have a gun on board and you can depressurize the cabin if a shot goes off for crying out loud.	
But, I I don't know, it it.	
.. it..	
. it...	
Christina Yeah.

Lynn and doing away with the *electorials.	
Dave Well, you know, you're you're talking about, um, the Constitution there, so, I mean, you know, it takes a lot to change the Constitution.	
I know they're also -- I've been reading some articles lately about they're -- thinking about, uh, uh, why should only a native born person be allowed to, uh, be President.	
Lynn Oh, I know.	
That is kind of interesting to -- think that, I mean, I think it'll be a long time before -- they would change that.	
Dave Yeah, but, uh, just in the last uh, well, actually just in the last month or so I -- is really the only time I've ever heard anybody even even talk about it.	
And, uh, well, I I -- I did read a a column today by, uh, a Hispanic fellow and, uh, he wasn't native born, he was from Cuba , and, uh, he stated that, uh, we he was in the fifth grade and and, uh, uh, he was taking -- no, I guess he was in middle school and he was taking a civics class and and it was pointed out to him that, you know, he could never become President.

Lynn Well, you know, in one sense it is but then, I mean -- well, my grandparents came over, Ellis Island and everything, but when I think about, you know, a foreign person or maybe born in another country and coming here it doe- it doesn't seem right in one sense for -- for them to be able to be President of this country .

Maybe eventually, you know, Dave Uh-huh.	
Lynn that won't make a you know, twenty or thirty, forty, fifty years down the road.	
Dave Right, eh, so what do you think about George Bush?	
Eh, are Lynn I I think he's a phony.	
I mean, that's another thing they were talking about that he is with the Skull and Bones from I think he went to Yale, Dave Right.	
Lynn and so was his father and and Clinton was, too, and and people actually that +alumina Dave And Kerry was a Skull and Bones, also.	
Lynn Also, yeah, and then they -- I don't know what else they're called but they're saying, like, they were like Satan people, Satan worshipers and, Dave Oh.	
Lynn you know, and you don't know what to believe.	
I watched a show on channel nine about Bush and him being religious, spiritual, of course, but also religious when his father wasn't, and -- I don't know.	
You know, you hea- I I think it's all a bunch of lies, and -- I I don't I'm not crazy about Bush.	
There're some things about him, you know, the fact that he does act spiritual and things like that, I like that, I think that's what got him in office but, Dave Uh-huh.	
Lynn um Dave Well what do you think of him as a man?	
Do you think he's, uh, a good man or do you think he's got -- any good qualities, or Lynn Uh, I -- you know, I want to say that he probably is but then I look at the things like where he wants -- the things he's done.	
I think that people are poorer.

Yeah they did.	
Obo in every state, and um -- I mean, the Republicans sort of tried to play like they were helping him out, but they knew they they didn't really have to because they knew the Democrats were already doing more damage to keep him off the ballot and they were successful, and for a progressive party that was very brutal.	
Ted Mhm, it was.	
Obo And I wasn't really impressed by either of the two vice presidential candidates, I know Dick Cheney seems to be running the show Ted You know?	
Obo and, ah -- I mean, and, and a lot of it has to do -- and then, I just didn't know much, John Edwards seemed nice, but he just, you know, he was just, he just got elected to the Senate, and, I wasn't really familiar too much with hi- I mean, I think it's great that he got into the vice presidential role, but -- again, it's the whole parties that I'm really not really I don't like their policies.	
Ted Well, you kind of hit on some of my sentiments, um, I'm a fifty-year- old black male, and this was my first election that I participated in.

Derek Yeah, you too.	
Marco Um Derek How's it going?	
Marco Good, good.	
So, uh the election, um -- the, um -- let's see, overall I felt -- ju- just give you a brief -- summary, I felt -- that -- John Kerry and Edwards were were pretty strong candidates and -- uh -- mm, I don't know, I guess just in terms of policy I didn't -- I didn't, uh, find -- that as compelling as just -- the personality of -- the different candidates.	
Derek Yeah.	
Marco felt like I could trust Kerry -- uh, little bit more even though he was much more of a politician than Bush.	
Derek Mhm.	
Mhm.	
Marco Uh, he was -- kind of a smooth talker and Derek Mhm.	
Marco Um -- uh -- seems like a politician, they way he presented Derek Mhm.	
Marco his you know his his um argument.	
But -- uh -- strangely I felt like that what, that was -- one of -- one of his good qualities because I didn't feel Bush was politician enough.	
That um -- one of the -- issues that I was concerned about was just -- the representation of the United States and -- on the international stage Derek Sure.	United States PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-6" type="COUNTRY"
Marco and I just -- uh -- I uh -- I don't know, uh, Bush is -- the way he presents um -- the ~ US position -- uh -- seemed a little -- abrasive to me.	US PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-4" type="COUNTRY"
Derek Mhm.	
Marco And I -- felt like, hm -- if we're trying to, um -- make -- um -- the United States safer and more stable -- conflict in the world more stable then we probably need somebody -- who is a little bit more -- of a politician in the sense that -- the, they care about diplomacy and -- uh, even though we may not -- give in to -- the will of the other nations present it in a nicer way.	United States PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-6" type="COUNTRY"
Derek Mhm.	
Marco Yeah, it seems ((I make)) kind of simplistic, but -- that was -- an important thing for me.	
Uh Derek Yeah.	
Marco Yeah.	
Derek Um -- I was a little different.	
I I I agree with everything you said.	
I just, um -- I come from a little different background as far as being -- I was never into politics and now I I actually have gotten into God much more and and, you know, searching spirituality out.	
Marco Uh huh.	
Derek Generally people like that are conservative, you know, Marco Yeah.	
Derek uh, with their views because of different things like abortion and, and, uh, pro-life and -- all that kind of thing so I came form that background Marco Uh huh.	
Derek eh, but that was just an added bonus for me in the fact that -- I too was obviously at this point in time concerned about the welfare of our security -- and I felt personally that if -- Kerry was in office we'd kind of be, uh -- up a creek without a paddle because I think -- he is so laid back -- um, and not as aggressive as Bush that at this point in the game, where we're at -- we're in this thing full full -- steam ahead Marco Uh huh.	
Derek and for a transition to occur at this point -- to someone who is laid back -- and not as aggressive as him I think would actually endanger the ~ US even more.	US PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-4" type="COUNTRY"
Marco Yeah.	
Derek I think that the international, uh uh, leaders would look at Kerry and know, they're very smart, I mean they're -- they're on top of these things, they know, you know, it would , it just would have opened a gateway.	
Marco Uh huh.	
Derek I feel Marco Yeah.	
Derek that, uh, it may have actually put us in more danger.	
At least Bush has -- pulled out the gun, you know, stick to them, and um -- you know, that's where I was coming from on that.	
Marco Yeah.	
Derek And then when I Marco ((Do you think)) Derek I listen to a lot of talk radio and when I heard the stuff about Kerry back in the -- the the, apparently the scandals he's pulled as far as the uh, medals when he served time.	
Marco Uh huh.	
Derek You know, uh -- I listen to a lot of talk radio and spoke with, you know, heard from a lot of, uh -- veterans -- and they said it was physically, uh, impossible for him to achieve what he said he did.	
Marco Uh huh.	
Uh huh.	
Derek And all the meetings he's missing, and just, you know, I think it's more of a status quo for him.	
Marco Yeah.	
Derek I think he's more, he got so much money that I think he was just concerned with attaining this position and a title.	
Marco Yeah.	
Derek you know ((flag)) for him, so Marco Do you think, um -- the -- when the Republicans are campaigning -- they were saying that well, another attack on the U.S. is -- imminent, that it probably -- probably going to happen -- and -- um -- and -- they even went so far to say that if -- it's really difficult to prevent something like this and of course they're doing the best they can and -- I think Kerry would do the best he could.

Ed Uh, Well, let's see, my past views were, uh -- illness-wise, ah -- I don't think -- it helped him, being in the compound . James Right.	
Right.	
Ed But, You're, you know, you're never going to know if there was any, ah, clandestine-type operation that -- Aided his, ah -- ah, illness.

Ed but I don't, you know, from just the generic point, or general point of view, it didn't help his illness once he got -- sick -- being in the compound , closed in like that with the Arabs.	
James Right.	
Right.	
Ed And that James I don't -- I don't know if I think there was something -- you know, malicious done, because, you know, looking back -- he's been had this shaking thing going on Ed Yeah.	
James for quite some time.	
And I agree that the surroundings couldn't have helped.	
Ed Right.	
James Yeah, it, it could've only exacerbated, uh, his situation.

James and, you know, it's like, um, uh, almost like he had, uh, what is that, Parkinson's?	
Ed Yeah.	
James Uh, something like that, but, uh, I don't know what the exact conditions were -- in that compound , but they couldn't have been couldn't have been, ah, conducive to someone of his age -- and of his health -- and as far as, as, ah, the United States sending a senior ~ US official, I think they should've sent someone -- I don't know how senior that person had to be.

Ed but it wasn't -- like, ah, wasn't Bush, I definitely wouldn't send him, I don't think you want to have him in that part of the world right now.	
James Right.	
No. No.	
No, I don't think Ed Regardless of what you think about him, he's, ah James Yeah, I don't think he should have went -- as a matter of fact, I don't think any senior official should've went, I don't think -- Secretary of State Colin Powell should have went.	
Uh, whoever they sent was, was good enough.	
Ed Yeah.	
James Yeah, was good enough, just to show -- the Palestinian people -- that, uh you know, America does care somewhat -- that you've lost your leader.

I I don't know if it'll move forward any better -- but, uh, this, uh, I've heard our administration thinks it will.

Paul maybe that Mike Well, you know, he was kind of damned if he did and damned if he didn't.

Well Mike You know, if he if he made peace he had factions of his own people that would've killed him -- and if he didn't make peace, eh, then he's considered, you know, the the warmongering, uh, man who won't make peace, you know.	
So, he, uh, he couldn't really win.	
I don't think he could make peace.	
I don't know if anyone else can, either.

Mike He's- I mean, like, you know, let's- i- -- for- for all he did in his later years, eh, Yasser Arafat was responsible for -- a good chunk of al- you know, a lot of -- Israeli dying -- i- you know.

I mean, on one hand -- I think it was kind of wrong that -- that -- you know, the ~UN just kind of went in and said, hey, you know, guess what?	
You know, we're- we're you know, this is Israel now, state of Israel .	Israel PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-7" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY"

Uh-huh.	
Mike um.	
You know, then it th- it was there, he had to try to maintain the status quo -- but they bred -- people like Yasser Arafat, I mean, if it -- if it wasn't for the stupidity of the United Nations, people like Yasser Yara- Arafat w- probably would've never even gotten off the ground, you know.

I'm not believe me, I'm not I'm not excusing -- anybody -- but for the purpose I I mean, the way I see it is you know, I guess for the purposes of the conversation th- -- that they want to hear, Marco Yeah.	
Mike y- you got to kind of have to put that as y- -- i- it's kind of like -- do if that's the case, do two wrongs really make a right?	
You know what I mean?	
Marco But if Arafat hadn't been I don't know if he's -- directly -- been linked to Hamas' acts, uh, but he was put in a -- pretty -- sticky situation having to negotiate -- the militants of -- Palestine -- the international leaders -- and if it if Hara- Arafat hadn't -- somehow appeased -- the Hamas groups or the Palestinian militants, then -- he would've been kicked out, overthrown -- by- -- by the Palestinians.

Marco Yeah.	
Yeah. Exactly.	
Well, it it's not really Arafat -- as an individual, I think it's just -- whatever leader -- is -- placed in the position of- Mike He was he was basically -- I mean, I've read I've read articles an- and- and- and -- stories that basically have linked him to the to the to the Munich -- massacre -- th- you know, the Munich Olympic massacre th- the Is- the Israeli team.

Ed Yeah.

Go up and celebrate with the family and -- be with the little kids.	
You know, the ((tough years)) and that which makes it -- because when you get older it's kind of, I've got all the gifts, I don't need that.	
What I really want to do is see somebody else enjoy it and the little kids enjoy it.	
So- -- and, uh, do a lot of parties with family -- and friends.	
Jane Well, that's kind of where- we're in between which family we're going to see and when and how and get all that worked out.	
Ed Uh, Jane Ed so whoev- yeah, I've seen them- -- just not the gifts it comes down to the food.	
See, now you (()).	
Jane There you go.	
I- one of these choices is meat cooking.	
We'll have to put that towards the end.	
Ed ((Ah, oui.)) -- Eh, ((nice)).	
So we- we've only- Jane Ed my family's, uh, parents are deceased and most of ((them)) is, uh, passed my brothers all over, so her family's still younger -- and, uh, you know, just the odd sides.	
She's the oldest and I'm the youngest, so she's got younger which -- keeps the thing going, so I- -- you know, my view is -- ((stay)) with the family go visit the family.	
That's all you got.	
So -- keep it together through thick and thin and -- when it comes to Thanksgiving we go up there and we celebrate.	
And then there's little parties.	
Big- uh, her sister does a big family party -- but try to keep that same Jane Ed local family coming together.	
It's amazing how they can get into little squabbles and who doesn't show up Jane Of course.	
Ed like that.	
I think it's crazy.	
So, ((so, uh))- Jane They used to always really all get together.	
but his parents uh they actually live next door to us.	
but they're starting to get up in the years, so they're not, you know, hosting the big parties, so it's funny how now people don't all bother to come Ed Yeah.	
Jane and you kind of wonder you know in the next couple of years what's all going to happen.	
Are they all going to see each other.	
Ed Yeah, no that's- that's exactly.	
I've already seen, you know, ((in)) my parents ((' bed)) until they ((got)) less and less that the brothers got together -- and then now when there's an event you try to do it.	
At Christmas it's just impossible because we leave -- two days after Christmas Jane Mhm.	
Ed to go out of the country as part of our New Year's Jane Ed celebration.

Jane Ed But- -- but for now we're still trying to do- Jane Ed as long as the mother's around, we'll still do Christmas and act as- Jane Ed she is not really old, but she's getting older, so I think that's one reason to stay together Jane Ed and also I think i- is Jane Ed eh, we- we kind of -- infused a little family party that her sister has so -- I think if we were to go away both of those might fall off a little bit and it doesn't take but one year and then all of the sudden everybody's Jane Yeah.

Deirdre Well, I guess they seem to think it's just special because -- everyone comes.	
I- I- it's- -- it's just, I don't know, old.	
Y- you know, it's- it's not- -- it's not special to me because they do it all the time.	
You know, special would make it, I only see you once a year.	
It's just not- it's just not special if I see you every other month.	
Ryan Yeah.	
Deirdre You know, it's just not.	
I mean, you know, not like, you're seeing your mother -- or your sister, maybe your brothers, you know, you- you might- you may see them all the time, but when you see your aunts and uncles and all your cousins -- all the time, where's the break here?

Bill Uh-huh.	
There's gangs all over here.	
Certain areas you just don't want to -- you just don't want to go through.	
Jenny I don't really have any good responses to their questions because they're -- there aren't any areas that I really avoid or anything like that.	
I mean, like I say, I live close to Springfield , Illinois , fairly close, and when I go there, if I want to go somewhere, I just go.

I just go and I think I probably should be a little more concerned but I'm not.	
Bill Well, I, you know, gro- living here, I just -- I'm always on the -- I'm always on guard it seems like.	
You know, you don't know -- you're -- certain neighborhoods you just can't- -- you g- you got to watch your back, you know.

Jenny Just because, eh, you go that far and you don't know your neighbors, you don't you don't know anybody.	
It's not really because of the crime, it's just more because you don't know anybody.	
Bill Right.	
Jenny And, so, I mean, I'm I'm really have a good comfort zone where I'm at because I know, like, almost everybody in town . So, I don't know, I guess we get kind of a false sense of security in these little towns.	town PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-21" state="IL" type="PPL"
Bill Yeah, until something happens, you know.	
Jenny Yeah.	
Bill It it only takes one person to kind of shock everybody.	
Jenny Oh, definitely.	
We have had, in the past, we've had some major crimes.	
We did have, um, a couple murders go on in town.	town PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-21" state="IL" type="PPL"
It was guys fighting over women and one guy shot the other guy and.	
.. and..	
. and...	
Bill Uh-huh.	
Jenny I mean, that's probably been thirty years ago.	
Bill Oh.	
Jenny And, probably the worst thing that we have now is people running their little meth labs or picking marijuana out of the corn field.	
So, it it seems like really small potatoes to me.	
I -- it doesn't seem like really big issues.	
Bill Well, meth labs are e- that's kind of a -- -- that can be dangerous.	
Jenny Oh yeah.	
Definitely.	
Bill Especially if they -- you know, m- most of those drug dealers have guns and it's like that can be a problem.	
Jenny And I think they're popping up more in the rural areas here because we have the accessibility to all the fertilizers and things that they use in that stuff.

Instead of him -- he didn't go in there with the intent to kill the man.	
I I do I do believe that because I know my cousin.

B But I do think that he went in there to scare him.	
But instead h- you know he didn't have the gun loaded.	
A He's on death row for one person?	
B Huh?	
A He's on death row for one person?	
Shooting one person?	
B Yeah.	
Well because of what they said because in the midst of the tussle, the gun went off and shot the man in the back of the head.	
A Uh what race was the man he shot?	
B The man was white.	
A What race is your cousin?	
B He's black.

Uh I'm um I um a I'm a counselor.

And that that doesn't sound right for him to be on death row for that.	
B Yeah, it was like -- but like I said they -- A No.	
B What they said was uh -- you know -- if you shoot a person in the back it's like well they didn't have a chance to defend themselves they kind of.	
A Right.	
Scott Peterson shot you know Scott Peterson?	
B Uh-huh A But he shot Laci and course she was eight months pregnant with Conner.	
Now I can see sending him to death row.

And uh they have gotten if in h- her parents have done everything they've known to try to get -- they're trying to get another trial.	
I don't know if they will or not.	
He's in jail for something else right now.	
B uh-huh A But not for killing her.	
B Mm. Yeah.	
A And that's not right.	
I don't care what color.	
It doesn't matter.	
But I don't see him being on death row, that's that you know.	
That's sad.	
B If if I mean if if it's weird the way you know different places determine -- A And his family's got to suffer for that.	
B Yeah, I mean it's like wh- what can you say like I said, it happened and you know I don't -- A Has he appealed it?	
B I don't think.	
Yeah he appealed it a few times now cause it's -- A Oh me.	
B He he's been -- it's two thousand four.	
He's probably been in jail for about nine years now maybe.	
A Oh wow, maybe they won't -- maybe somehow they'll get it where he won't be executed.	
B Yeah because that's the thing.	
Up here people are on death row for long periods of time.	
A Well that's good.	
I'd hate to see that.	
B Oh.	
A Because I know that was wrong what he did.	
B Mhm.	
A And we should pay the price.	
B Yeah.	
A But I don't see -- No.	
B Yeah, so I mean th- stuff like that happens but I I don't I don't see I mean -- that's what I was asking you was the the type of crime.	
Like up here I would say a lot of it has to do with money.	
Getting money for.	
A Right, we have some that.	
We have burglaries and stuff.	
B Mhm.	
A But the murders we have are mostly from more the passion or anger.	
B Yeah.	
A Right.	
B Now see, up here a lot of people get shot or or robbed or whatever a lot of crime has to do like I said with people getting killed.	
A Right.	
B Uh not uh maybe a year ago a boy was shot in the back over a basketball jersey that he was wearing.	
A Oh.	
B He was shot and paralyzed.	
A I guess you can tell I am white.	
B You know. uh Yeah.	
A Yeah, but I'm going to tell you uh you know I'm for justice for whatever, but that is really bad when they go shoot somebody for a basketball jersey.

A I'm not kidding they get killed for their shoes in the cities and stuff and stuff.	
B Yeah.	
A And that just that just breaks my heart.

A But uh we shoul- but you know uh, I meant whatever our crime rate.

B Uh-huh A Yeah.	
And uh.	
B Yeah, it's uh that's what -- but that's what it would boil down to.	
I think we need to -- uh if the economy was ever to get straightened out you know and the job rate, the unemployment rate would go down, you would see things stop but the way things are going it's like.

We just had a big plant close down here.

A Right.	
Allan I mean, if they leave -- if they leave, you know, if the- eh, let's say they, you know, they just leave right now, you know, the the -- they can't, you know, I don't think the -- the -- the occupants themselves regain control and, you know, and mo- and, you know, and -- put down the power and, you know, an- and control everything they can.	
They just need they, you know, they need assistance and to get off -- get off, you know, on the right step.	
I think they're going to need the military to be in there.	
And assist them with the elections and they need to complete the elections and all this.	
A Yeah, um, yeah, I don't know what the end game, per se, is going to be there, you know, because, eh, they- the problem is the- is the culture, you know, it's -- pretty, uh, you know, it's really almost like a modern day Crusades, you know, and that's- that's kind of hard, you know.	
A lot of -- there's a lot of embitterment that goes back generations and stuff, so, you know, we have -- I don't know, I always think we have such a short mindset, uh, but they don't.

I- -- eh, I just -- I- I think the situation could be handled better.	
I- I thought it was a great idea fir- them going in there -- and doing what they did but, uh, they had a short window of opportunity to win over the people and it didn't happen.	
I don't know if that was just out of our control or- or what or if we could've done a better job but, uh, you know.	
Allan Do you support the -- do you- do you support the war?

A Yeah.	
Yeah, I did at first I just- I just -- I -- don't like the way it was managed.	
I think -- I think, uh, they did a great job up front, of course.

You know, they- Allan Yeah, I- I agree also.	
Yeah, I- I mean, I- I did support the war.	
I just think that when they went in there, you know they -- they just didn't -- you know, they didn't i- execute everything correctly, you know there was problems, you know.	
A Yeah.	
Allan And I think I mean, that that lead to it, but yeah, I mean they -- I mean eh you know you're already in it, so you know, you shouldn't -- you can't just walk down and, you know, stop, you got to complete what you're doing, you know.

I don't know.	
Eh, if they could've -- if they could've shored up the borders, right after going in there, that would've been a -- that would've been a- a big plus, you know.	
I don't know if that could, uh, if that's a -- plausible goal or not because, uh, it's just that- that -- a lot of that's, you know, uh, weapons and terrorists have been, you know, getting through the borders, probably from Syria .

 Mischie in jail	
the main opposition party, has been jailed.	
Romania voted in the last December, ousting the so-called socialist party PSD (Social-Democratic Party).	Romania PLACE country="RO" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:20100038" id="Pl-2" latLong="46.000°N 25.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
PSD managed to keep a stronghold in poor rural areas, with the help of people like Mischie.	
They combined blackmail, using their right of decision regarding the public funds for local leaders opposing PSD, and strong seduction of the uneducated masses, in a marvelous way.	
E.g., Mischie, who talks like an idiot, got a PhD in history.	
His paper was on a political personality of the 19th century and Mischie bought the house where his paper's subject lived.	house PLACE country="RO" form="NOM" id="Pl-94" type="FAC"
Maybe he tried to invest in his paper, maybe he believed sincerely in his admiration for the poor innocent dead guy and his ability of earning PhDs, but using a big car and living in a big house are signs for the masses that the man is an invaluable and irreplaceable leader.	house PLACE country="RO" form="NOM" id="Pl-94" type="FAC"
Another misleading sign was his position as a University professor - he was teaching mostly at private universities, which are still ways to buy diplomas here in Romania .	Romania PLACE country="RO" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:20100038" id="Pl-2" latLong="46.000°N 25.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
Local leaders did their jobs, but national leaders, pressuring TV stations to lie, associating with old communist ex-president Ion Iliescu, failed to win in big cities.	
PSD is building a strategy for the 4 years to come and they are going to elect a leader.	
It is known that communist leaders die in office (as judges of the U.S. Supreme Court) and Ion Iliescu won't be different.	U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-4" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
All the leaders that expressed different points of view will be excluded from the party, that's the untold truth that Romanian media seem to hide or not conceive yet.

Mischie was right to criticize the national leaders, because PSD got a good share in the elections in his area.	
But Mischie was wrong, because he did that while in vacation in Switzerland , where you can't go if you earn 20K $ a year.	Switzerland PLACE country="CH" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17445610" id="Pl-5" latLong="47.000°N 8.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
The new power had nothing to do, but let the policemen do what they should be doing years ago.	
Iliescu and Nastase, ex-president and ex-prime minister, are now left only with the leadership of the party and holding this illusory authority.	
If Mischie wouldn't take his chance on them, he would still be free, with the help of the weak and weakening strings Iliescu might still pull.

 Biography of Jo-Ann Bellucci	
Mon, 10 Jan 2005 02:57:20 -0800 Biography of Jo-Ann Bellucci My biography changed completely 5 years ago when I contracted a very severe case of fibromyalga.	
Usually I say nothing about it although it has severly limited my life, no truthly changed it completely!	
This time I decided to just say it up front and go back and talk about the good old days, when life was a kick!	
I now live in Watertown , MA , 12 miles from Boston 's Logan airport, in a lovely two family house I bought as an investment with my boss, my 9 year old Yorkshire Terrier, Teddy!

I just turned 50 years old this Christmas.	
When I had a j.o.b.	
I ran a software company for a few years and then started my own company, Pinnacle Business Enterprises and was under a 5 year exclusive contract with PriceWaterhouoseCoopers doing a lot of interesting things like Business Process Engineering, processes but mostly people and the effect new process would have on them.	
Showing them how to invite change into their lives because it freed them from the mundanne tasks and allowed them to use their great creativity instead of their backs.	
I'll get on to the more fun stuff (read embarrassing, teasable stuff)in a minute but just one business story.	
Those of you in Louisianna are very familiar with what used to be The Akzo Salt Mines.	Louisianna PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1630543" id="Pl-5" latLong="31.000°N 92.000°W" state="LA" type="CIVIL"
On a client visit one day, unexpectedly, they dressed me up in safety equipment and ran me down the mine shaft.	
I mention this because I never really got over, after that, how much we take advantage of evryday things ...like the salt on our tables or the rock salt that keeps the northern cities moving in the winter!	
After I learned how to breath with my emergency apparatice I was driven around to see the manufacturing sites.	
I'm sure we are all familiar with those Yellow Tonka trucks little boys play with and move dirt from one place to another....well just imagine an ENTIRE UNDERGROUND CITY with a variety of those types of trucks (erath movers, backhoes etc) EXCEPT the tires alone are 8 foot tall!	
Its then that I realized that life is ever so much more then you can see on the surface in all aspects!	
Ok Chris ... here comes the stuff you can pay me back with.	
I am an excellent dancer, started before I could walk.	
I've studied ballet, tap, toe, jazz and modern and studied opera singing for a while.	
Due to the medications necessitated by my illness, I have lost 150 lbs twice,and in between illnesses, I modelled for several of both trendy and elegant boutique and department stores as well as did runway work.	
One day I'll show you my portfolio.	
I grew up in what at that time was rural NJ and my father was an avid hunter and sportsman.	NJ PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780795" id="Pl-7" latLong="40.167°N 74.500°W" state="NJ" type="CIVIL"
My father, way ahead of his time in his thinking, was an equal oportunty thinker... that is why I can and love to shoot skeet, was a champion archer as a child, learned to camp and hike and drive a speedboat, kayack of course canoe and when I recover Chris, I will join you white wather rafing because I have only done level three but what an unbelievable rush!!	
I love to craft, I knit, crochet, make furniture, paint and garden.	
I consider myself and "ALL AMERICAN GIRL" when that wasn't a politically incorrect phrase to use.	
I am single, and I teach religious education to teenagers as a challenge and as service to God ... but mostly because they are some of the most interesting, difficult people you can teach ... but I love them and once you teach them, they are GOLD.	
Both my houses, in NJ and Boston are always open to friends and those who would be friends.

 organizations committee	
Fri, 11 Feb 2005 17:13:41 -0800 (PST) organizations committee Howdy, Lauren Rouse here.	
I'm in charge of getting everyone excited about contacting organizations so Marcella can meet with them.	
Next week we want to have as many dates as possible set up for her as we can, so we are asking y'all to please talk to your organizations to see if they would be interested in having Marcella come and speak.	
In the near future we will be expanding this to include all the other organizations that we can contact, but we are just keeping things safe for now.	
If you are interested in helping out with contacting organizations then please let me know, cause I need all the help I can get.	
There are 6 sub committees under the organizations committee: Greek (2) Department of Multicultural services (Tasha should have this taken care of) MSC (2, but I think Crystal is taking care of some of this but she still will need some help) Student Activities (3) Academics and colleges (2) International (1) I am going to need that number of people to help with contacting people in these areas, so please let me know asap.	
So, as I said earlier please just stick to contacting your organizations this weekend and friends you may have in other organizations.	
I have attached the welcome packet info if they are interested and I have the cheat sheet to use as a guideline for when you talk to them (just in case you don't have them yet).	
Remember to stress that Marcella can either meet with the execs or the whole group (whatever works best), that she will be talking briefly, and that she will be there because she wants to learn about that group's concerns and issues at A&amp;M. Don't say anything like "vote for Marcella" or "support Marcella" cause we don't want anyone to get in trouble.	
If they are interested in setting up a meeting then have them contact me at 979-777-6445 or at laurouse...@yahoo.com and I will send the info to Tori, or have them contact Tori Foster to set up a time.	
Also, let me know who you have already contacted and set up a meeting with so that I can make sure we don't call them twice.	
Ok guys, sorry for the long e-mail and the rambling, but I want to make sure that I have everything covered.	
And if you have any questions feel free to contact me at the numbers, addresses above.	
Thanks y'all!	
Have a great weekend!

 Daylight Savings Time is retarded	
2004-11-03T13:00:00 I am 36 years old.	
I've been around a while.	
I'm not 87 or anything, but I've seen some things in my life.	
I have initially agreed and disagreed with different things over the years, only to have my mind changed later.	
However, I will never EVER change my mind about the idiocy we call Daylight Savings Time.	
I Googled "Daylight Savings Time" and I got the following link: http: webexhibits.org daylightsaving I started reading.	
.. reading..	
. reading...	
The site says things like "We've learned to save energy and enjoy sunny summer evenings by switching our clocks an hour forward in the summer" and there's no S at the end of Savings.	
It should be Daylight Saving Time.	
My apologies to the assclowns that invented this idiocy and the goobers that perpetuate it in such a ridiculous fashion.	
I will concede that "springing forward" and "falling back" are good ways to remember to change the batteries in your smoke detectors.	
However, New Years and the Fourth of July would do the same thing.	
I kept reading the website of propoganda and found that the first person to come up with the idea was Benjamin Franklin who did it on behalf of some friends that owned oil companies (oil was used in lamps).	
I assume that, because the idea was dumb and inconvenient, lots of people ignored it.	
"By 1966, some 100 million Americans were observing DST based on their own local laws and customs.	America PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-8" type="COUNTRY"
Congress decided to step in to end the confusion and establish one pattern across the country .	country PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" type="COUNTRY"
The Uniform Time Act of 1966 (15 U.S. Code Section 260a) which was signed into Public Law 89-387 on 12 April 1966, by President Lyndon Johnson, created Daylight Saving Tim to begin on the last Sunday of April and to end on the last Sunday of October.	U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
Any State that wanted to be exempt from DST could do so by passing a state law.	
There's a LOT more to this since then, and you can read a lot more it if you want to, but this is what I know: Indiana 's eastern half doesn't use it.	Indiana PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:449508" id="Pl-3" latLong="40.000°N 86.250°W" mod="E" state="US-IN" type="CIVIL"
What's THAT all about?	
Arizona doesn't use it because one tribe of Indians stretches into three states.	Arizona PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780777" id="Pl-4" latLong="34.500°N 111.500°W" state="US-AZ" type="CIVIL"
But those other states DO use it.	
Hawaii doesn't use it at all.	Hawaii PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780782" id="Pl-6" latLong="20.750°N 156.500°W" state="US-HI" type="CIVIL"
Of course, they're closer to Japan than to us, and since Japan doesn't use it, Hawaii just plays along.

(Do you think the Hawaiian's sit around, staring west, just becuase they still don't trust the Japs?) Regardless of when I go to bed (11pm or 10pm or 9pm), I get up at 5:30 and I am fucking exhausted.	Hawaii PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780782" id="Pl-6" latLong="20.750°N 156.500°W" state="US-HI" type="CIVIL"
How can that be?	
I slept the same number of hours as I did two weeks ago, yet I'm tired?	
Also, I am so hungry I could eat my little tub of Carmex by 10:30am every day.	
I used to eat lunch between 11:30 and noon, but now, eating is all I think about after 10am.	
Why is that good for me?	
I don't care if America saves 1% of its energy consumption costs during those times.	America PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-8" type="COUNTRY"
I am tired, hungry, and I leave for work and get home from work in the dark.	
How healthy is that?	
For that matter, I don't care about any of the pro-farming or anti-crime propoganda.	
Daylight SAVINGS Time sucks!!	
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go stalk the lobby for the girls that are bringing me my Krystals. order and fight to keep myself from falling asleep in my cube.

After all the smack talk that's gone on for the last 360 days, and all of the games that both teams have played and the hopes each had for the 2004 season, it's come down to this.	
To stay undefeated and alive for a chance at the BCS title game, Auburn must win this Saturday in it's 3:30 EST game on CBS against the Georgia Bulldogs.

This game is as good as it gets.	
Sure, Auburn 's in-state rival is Alabama , but year in and year out, this game, the Auburn -UGA game, seems like the one that matters more.

The game is big enough already, but it seems even bigger when one or both teams have something on the line.	
Yes, both teams have other games left to play and yes, other teams' results may affect what happens to both of these teams, but in just five days, these two teams will play the biggest and most important game of their season.	
So now it's time for all of the yapping and jawing and talking shit that goes with this game.	
Except I don't do that.	
I can't do that.	
Anytime I try to talk shit, I get all nauseous and worry about what happens not if but WHEN we lose.	
I don't know if it's just me or if being this pragmatic is what it means to be an Auburn fan.	Auburn PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-7" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" predicative="true" state="US-AL" type="PPL"
I wonder if deep down THIS is what it feels like to be a Red Sox fan: regardless of where you are or what is happening to your team, deep down you don't just think, you KNOW something bad is going to happen.	
Anyway, I am flying my flag on my house with pride and I am looking forward to the game that, year in and year out, gives us the best hitting and mos entertaining football played on the highest level.	
It's SEC football at it's core.

This trend was serious in the 80's, with the road team winning about two-thirds of the time.	
The only time this changed recently really was when UGA decided to win in their place in 2003.	
Thanks Dawgs. Blurble..	
. On the upside, Auburn has scored at least 33 points in the last six games.	Auburn PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-19" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL"
That's a pretty nice run.	
Auburn leads the SEC in scoring offense, scoring defense and rushing defense.	Auburn PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-19" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL"

Here are a couple of middle of the road stats: Auburn 's Quentin Groves and Georgia 's David Pollack are tied for the SEC sack lead.

Here's the biggest for what it's worth stat as far as I am concerned: both teams are undefeated this year when scoring first.	
Auburn is 8-0 and UGA is 5-0.	Auburn PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-19" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL"
I'd say that's the biggest stat right now.	
Auburn 's offense is potent and efficient.	Auburn PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-19" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL"
UGA's defense is relentless and contains a couple of the country 's biggest hitters, especially Greg Blue and Odell Thurman.	country PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-30" type="COUNTRY"
Auburn 's defense is fast and relentless and the DB's are experienced and big.	Auburn PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-19" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL"
UGA's receivers are leaders, with one of them a team captain.	
Auburn 's two running backs are seniors and very experienced and dangerous, bruising backs.	Auburn PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-19" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL"
UGA's two backs are smaller freshmen with less experience, but are dangerous as well.	
In my mind, the game is going to turn on a few key points, some obvious and some not.	
Here goes the prediction machine: - Turnovers (as always) will be critical.	
- Special teams play and lack of special teams mistakes will tell the tale regarding field position.	
- Both teams MUST establish the run to be successful.	
If Auburn goes for 150 between their two backs, they're almost impossible to beat.	Auburn PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-19" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL"
Conversely, Georgia MUST be able to run the ball to set up play action and keep the pressure off of David Greene. - Mark Richt has proven to be a better on the fly adjustment coach that Tommy Tuberville.

Tubs is famous for taking chances, often unnecessary ones.	
That history is of concern to me.	
While it's okay to try crazy shit when your team is under-rated or a serious underdog, it's important not to give games away when you're the favorite.	
Playing more "by the book" and a bit "closer to the vest" becomes the call for the day.	
Considering all of these factors, I truly believe that this is Auburn 's year.	Auburn PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-19" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL"
They may not go undefeated and they may not get into the BCS title game, but they have enough talent, poise and experience to win this game.	
Auburn wins 31-21.	Auburn PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-19" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL"
And now that I have typed that prediction, I may just throw up in my mouth.

2004-11-17T07:23:00 You know, for the past five days and really for about the past fifteen or twenty days, I've been angry about the BCS rankings and why Auburn isn't ranked higher and all of that business.

Can someone tell me why one of my friends or family members hasn't smacked me because of it?	
I mean, here we are, 10-0 and staring down the barrell of a road game AT Tuscaloosa against our hated rivals, the Alabama Crimson Tide, and I'm bitching about how we better get to play for a national title?

Really?	
You don't have to think back too far to find a similar scenario, only with the shoe firmly on the other foot.	
In 1989, Alabama was 10-0, number two in the nation and coming into Auburn for the first time ever to play at Jordan-Hare Stadium .	Auburn PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:355411" id="Pl-8" latLong="34.014°N 83.828°W" state="US-GA" type="PPL",Jordan-Hare Stadium PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-143" state="US-GA" type="FAC",Alabama PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780775" id="Pl-12" latLong="32.750°N 86.750°W" predicative="true" state="US-AL" type="CIVIL",nation PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" type="COUNTRY"
All the talk for the weeks leading up to the game was about "if Bama 's undefeated, they'll play for it all in the Sugar Bowl" and other crap like that.	Bama PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780775" id="Pl-14" latLong="32.750°N 86.750°W" state="US-AL" type="CIVIL"
Well, "if or when" never happened because Auburn won 30-20 in one of the greatest Iron Bowl games ever, putting an end to Bama 's national title hopes for the year.	Auburn PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:355411" id="Pl-8" latLong="34.014°N 83.828°W" state="US-GA" type="PPL",Bama PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780775" id="Pl-14" latLong="32.750°N 86.750°W" state="US-AL" type="CIVIL",nation PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" type="COUNTRY"
15 years later, the situation's reversed.	
It's Auburn that's undefeated and facing the road game at the end of the season.	Auburn PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:355411" id="Pl-8" latLong="34.014°N 83.828°W" state="US-GA" type="PPL"
Suddenly, I'm about nauseous about this game too.	
Despite being riddled with injuries, Alabama has a ridiculously stout defense, recently ranked as the number one defense in the country . Egad.	Alabama PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780775" id="Pl-12" latLong="32.750°N 86.750°W" predicative="true" state="US-AL" type="CIVIL",country PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" type="COUNTRY"
Has all of the bluster and talking shown up on The Plains as well?	
I only hope that Coach Tuberville has been successful at keeping his players focused, motivated and thinking about ONLY the Alabama game.	Alabama PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780775" id="Pl-12" latLong="32.750°N 86.750°W" predicative="true" state="US-AL" type="CIVIL"
 Do people never learn from the mistakes of others?	
2004-11-17T11:07:00 For those of you not from around these parts, Linda Schrenko WAS the State of Georgia 's Superintendant of schools.	State of Georgia PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1706317" id="Pl-1" latLong="32.750°N 83.500°W" state="US-GA" type="CIVIL"
It seems that in recent years, instead of doing the people's business, good ole Linda has spent her time stealing over 600 grand in Federal Education funds.	
She used it for various things, but the favorite is the nine grand she spent on a facelift.	
Here's a link to the story: link One thing that made me laugh is that she showed up at her indictment in a fur coat.	
Ummm, am I the only one that learned anything from the Michael Irvin drug trial of the mid 90's?	
You never EVER show up at court, especially facing indictment for stealing large sums of money, wearing a fucking FUR COAT!!	
Fake or not, you look like you're rubbing the common man's nose in it.	
Schrenko is a scumbag and, although she won't get any actual jail time, I hope the fine she pleads to is at least as much as what she stole.	
Otherwise, she's learned nothing.	
Remember when Michael Milken got busted, he was not forced to give up his secret accounts, and when the fine of 600 million was levied.	
..HE levied..	
.HE levied...	
HE PAID IT!!	
Hell, at his zenith, that's what he made in ONE YEAR!! "Um...how much, your honor? 600 large?	
Yeah, lemme just get my checkbook out of my diamond encrusted briefcase."	
Schrenko stole 20 times what Martha Stewart did, and I bet she won't see the wrong side of a jail cell door, and that's sad.	
Because it's people like Schrenko for which jails were specifically designed...	
 1 day to glory...	
2004-11-19T10:02:00 Well, it's mid-morning on the East coast and I am sitting here running numbers thru my head trying to figure out what's going to happen in the Iron Bowl, which is just over 29 hours away.

Conversely, Auburn has one of the most potent and balanced offensive attacks in the nation .	Auburn PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-25" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL",nation PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-29" type="COUNTRY"
Also, I don't think Bama has faced an attack with two great runners, a great line, a poised QB and good receivers and a tight end as well.	Bama PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780775" id="Pl-17" latLong="32.750°N 86.750°W" predicative="true" state="US-AL" type="CIVIL"

The fact that they've won six games is a testament to the coaching and heart of the players.	
Alabama simply cannot throw the football, which is a good thing, because Auburn 's defensive backfield is second to none.

Unfortunately for them, with no passing game to keep the defense honest, Auburn will probably stack nine in the box, play man on the corners, and dare Bama to run, and I don't think they'll be able to do it.

Auburn is also 9-0 when they score first.	Auburn PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-25" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL"
The Tuberville way is to get one quick and early to get your crowd into it if you're at home and to quiet the other team's crowd if you're on the road.	
You can never tell what is going to happen in rivalry games.	
In this exact game 15 years ago, Bama came into Auburn #2 in the country , undefeated at 10-0 and looking for yet another national championship.	national PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-30" type="COUNTRY",Auburn PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-25" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="US-AL" type="PPL",Bama PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780775" id="Pl-17" latLong="32.750°N 86.750°W" predicative="true" state="US-AL" type="CIVIL",nation PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-29" type="COUNTRY",country PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-26" type="COUNTRY"
They were summarily trounced 30-20 in a game in which the score was closer than the actual game.	
That could very well happen Saturday.	
I always tell people that the Georgia game matters more to me than the Bama game.

 Somebody alert the media!!!	
2004-12-02T07:11:00 Apparently Jason Giambi, recently the non-playing and "sick" first baseman of the New York Yankees, admitted to a Grand Jury that he "injected anabolic steroids and human growth hormone (HGH) as recently as 2003.	New York PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-1" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" predicative="true" state="US-NY" type="PPL"
And he apparently got them thru BALCO and (surprise) the same guy that is Barry Bonds' trainer, once Greg Anderson.	
Since that Grand Jury testimony was given, Giambi repeatedly denied using any steroids, HGH, or anything else to anyone and everyone that would listen.	
Jason's brother Jeremy also admitted to the grand jury that he used steroids.	
Now, Barry is denying he's done any steroids and Gary Sheffield's denying he's done any steroids, but one by one, the lesser (and bigger) players in this deal are seeing their testimony coming into the the public eye where they admitted that they DID do steroids.	
It seems that anyone associated with this special "trainer" Greg Anderson is coming up dirty.	
It's a good thing that Major League Baseball has such a tough steroid policy, or this story may not have been brought to our attention.	
(cough...cough...sarcasm...cough).	
Never mind if the steroids and human growth hormones were illegal in baseball or not.	
They are illegal to use in the United States .	United States PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" type="COUNTRY"
I want to know where the Federal criminal charges against all parties involved are.	
Anyone?	
The fact that these guys (Sheff, the Giambis, Marion Jones, Bonds and many others) are running around denying this shit and acting like Pete Rose did any time someone asked him about gambling (getting uber defensive, denying it implicitly and acting like the person asking had personally assaulted him) is appalling.	
These clowns are messing with people's careers by insisting they're being lied about, yet when it turns out the reporters weren't lying and the athletes were, nothing is done.	
I have never denied that Barry Bonds was a special and gifted athlete.	
Whether it's steroids, HGH, crank, lighter fluid or antifreeze he's using, being able to perform at this level for this length of time defies logic or reason.	
That's why it's a shame that, in the final analysis, all of Bonds' numbers and accomplishments are going to be ignored and lumped into the statement "yeah, but he was on steroids."	
It's a pity he and the others are too dumb to see that.	
And now, just so you don't think that every entry in this blog will be like the one above, here's a great joke I read today: A man takes his Rottweiler to the vet and says, "My dog's cross-eyed, is there anything you can do for him?	
" "Well," says the vet, "let's have a look at him."	
So he picks the dog up and examines his eyes, then checks his teeth.	
Finally, the vet says "I'm going to have to put him down." "What?	
Because he's cross-eyed?"	
"No, because he's really heavy."	
I will be breaking down the SEC championship game either later today or tomorrow, so I expect you all to be planted firmly on the edge of your seats waiting for that one.

They also won their first outright SEC title since 1987 and won their first SEC title since the conference implimented the Championship game format.	
A year ago, the program was in disarray and the coach was one poorly executed plane trip away from being fired by an over-zealous and too empowered booster with a fat checkbook.	
Since that day, the team is undefeated and has won 14 games in a row.

USC won by five over a shitty UCLA team with a 6-5 record, and that was thanks in part to an official who blew dead a clear and obvious fumble that would have been returned for a UCLA touchdown.	
Oklahoma played in it's conference title game against a four-loss Colorado team that can't throw the ball.

The result was a 40 plus point beatdown, but what did anyone expect?	
Auburn played 15th ranked Tennessee and was attempting to do one of the toughest things to do in college football: beating a team twice in the same year.

With the exception of a 15 yard shanked punt and a punt snap that Kody Bliss missed while having an apparent thrombosis, Auburn led 21-7 at the half and had held UT to 46 yards of offense.

This despite several late hits to the head, low hits at his knees and ankles, and various other assaults outside the realm of good sportsmanship.	
Tennessee scored on a pass play that was incorrectly ruled a touchdown, since the ball clearly touched the turf, and that's where the momentum of the game changed.	Tennessee PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1326873" id="Pl-18" latLong="35.750°N 86.250°W" state="US-TN" type="CIVIL"

I can't believe that an undefeated SEC team is not playing for a title, but I guess we can thank Jeff Sagarin and the other dicks that keep voting USC number one to make up for what happened to them last year.

 So get this...	
2004-12-16T06:56:00 I'm reading ESPN this morning when I stumbled across the story where Kobe Bryant said he'd like to sit down with Shaq and apologize to him for "involving him in my troubles."	
Bryant also says that he thinks December 25th "sounds like a good day to me to kind of talk to him and tell him I never meant in any kind of way to bring any of his personal business out."	
You see, after Kobe's world fell apart because he couldn't resist banging the crazy white towel clerk at his hotel, he needed an out.	
He bought his wife a four million dollar ring and got some tattoos that said how much he loved her, but he needed to do more to attract attention away from himself.	
So he told the media that he should have done what Shaq always did, just pay the women to shut up.	
Kobe also alleged that O'neal had paid upwards of one million dollars in this way as hush money over the years.	
Shaq has denied it from the beginning, but that's not really the point.	
It's no secret that a large number of the NBA's "stars" are not exactly star-worthy.	
Good players or not, guys like Kemp and Bryant and Iverson and the entire Blazers team are just not very nice or good people.	
If the league will tolerate it, what do I care?	
But the real issue is this.	
Kobe's Lakers will play Shaq's Miami Heat on...that's right...December 25th.	Miami PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:296004" id="Pl-1" latLong="25.774°N 80.194°W" state="FL" type="PPL"
So the real motivation for Kobe here is not to mend fences or admit he was wrong to involve any other person in his own little pit of woe.	
It is to find some sort of way to keep the 340-pound Shaquille and his teammates from beating the ever-loving shit out of Kobe for 48 pain-filled minutes on Christmas Day.	
I can't tell you the number of ways that Kobe Bryant makes me sick.	
Despite his slick talk and his nice diction, he's nothing but a cheater and a liar and a punk.	
I hardly watch any NBA games because the league and most of it's players sicken me, but I've had December 25th circled on my calendar since the day after Shaq signed with the Heat.	
That's the day that Shaq will take a million dollars or more out of Kobe's punk-ass.	
 It ain't much...	
2004-12-17T16:39:00 Sorry I haven't been posting much lately.	
We have been so damned busy with the holidays (that's what we call December at our house ) that I just haven't had time.	house PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-7" state="US-AK" type="FAC"
I read a funny joke today and I thought I'd share it with you.	
One of my fellow eggers posted it, so Chet, here's your credit: A traveler was driving through Arkansas when he lost his way and got off the main highway .	highway PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-2" state="US-AK" type="ROAD",Arkansas PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:69085" id="Pl-1" latLong="34.750°N 92.500°W" state="US-AK" type="CIVIL"
As he drove by, he saw rows and rows of pigsties and pigpens and pigs running in fields and pigs wallowing in mud.	
Suddenly, his eye caught something really strange.	
He did a double take, muttered to himself and then looked a third time.	
He wondered if he had seen correctly - it looked like a pig with a wooden leg!	
He found the lane to the farm and drove up into the farmyard , where he was met by the farmer.	farm PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-3" state="US-AK" type="FAC",farmyard PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-4" state="US-AK" type="FAC",lane PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-8" state="US-AK" type="ROAD"
"Excuse me," the traveler said.	
"I was just driving by and looking at all your pigs, and I noticed something that I just had to stop and ask about.	
Tell me, did I see right?	
Is there really a pig out there with a wooden leg?"	
The farmer smiled.	farm PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-3" state="US-AK" type="FAC"
"Oh, that would be old Caesar you saw.	
He's the finest pig a man could ever hope to have - and smart!	
Well, let me tell you a little about that pig.	
You see that barge down there on the river?	
That's a mining dredge, taking out platinum ore.	
Old Caesar sniffed out the vein and showed us how to set it up.	
Now that dredge brings me in about $120,000 every year.	
"There's another thing, too, a little more personal.	
One night a couple of years ago I got to drinking and I guess I had more than I should have.	
I passed out drunk, fell down and knocked over a lamp.	
That started a fire in the house and old Caesar smelled the smoke.	house PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-7" state="US-AK" type="FAC"
He came in the back door, got the wife and kid out, roused me up and got me out.	
"There is no question about it - that night old Caesar saved all our lives and you know that is not the sort of thing a man is going to forget too easily."	
"Why," the traveler said, "this is all amazing!	
I have never heard of a pig like this before!	
This is fantastic!	
But tell me, how did he get that wooden leg?	
Was he in a wreck or something?"	
The farmer laughed and said, "Well, naturally, when you have a pig that smart, you don't want to eat him all at one time!"	farm PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-3" state="US-AK" type="FAC"
 Did anyone see the Packers game Sunday?	
2004-12-20T09:19:00 While it was entertaining, that's not why I'm posting about it.	
I don't normally post about pro football, but what I saw deserved a ranting or two, and I suspect it's going to get many more in the days and weeks to come.	
With 4:41 left in the fourth quarter and the Packers down by 11, Favre hit Robert Ferguson with a 31 yard strike near the left hash marks.	
Coming from the other direction, Jacksonville DB Donovin Darius unloaded chin high on Ferguson with a vicious clothesline.	
Remarkably, Ferguson held on to the ball, despite being disjoined from his helmet on the hit.	
After many minutes lying motionless on the field , Ferguson was finally removed via stretcher, giving a thumbs up to the crowd on the way out.	field PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-0" type="FAC"
The Packers went on to lose the game, but that's not the story here.	
This was not one of the staged stiff-armed clotheslines you see in professional wrestling broadcasts.	
This was a vicious, arm cocked and swinging clothesline that literally could have torn Ferguson's head off of his body.	
The play was immediately flagged, and moments later it was announced that Darius had been ejected, much to the crowd's delight.	
One sidenote here is that, despite their rabid fandom and the situation, not one thing was thrown at the offending player as he left the field .	field PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-0" type="FAC"
It would have been easy to bathe him in beer or snowballs or batteries as he left, but the Packer fans are classier than that.	
To a person, they acted with class, using their voices and not projectiles to express their displeasure.	
This was the most vicious and blatantly dirty play I have seen in the NFL since Jim McMahon was body slammed to the ground in the mid 80's about five seconds after he had released a pass.	
And Jaguars coach Jack Del Rio and Darius had the nerve to vociferously argue with officials about Darius' ejection from the game.	
I don't care what anyone says about "you can't judge intent."	
Darius' intent was to dismember, injure or even kill Ferguson.	
The more I saw the replay, the sicker it made me feel.	
The league must take action, and it must be swift and sure.	
I'm talking about a four game suspension that included the playoffs if necessary.	
In this day and age of bigger, stronger and faster players, injuries are going to happen accidentally all of the time.	
There is simply no room for the kind of play that resulted in Ferguson's injury.	
Paul Tagliabue must give word to all of his employees that actions like this will not be tolerated.	
Maybe that will tell the Jaguars, Darius and players like him that this kind of head-hunting will not be tolerated in the NFL.	
If not, I fully expect the Packers and many other teams to handle this matter "on the field" with Darius being the target of similar attacks by tight ends and offensive lineman.	field PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-0" type="FAC"
 I forgot to tell you this...	
2005-01-03T08:29:00 I was on vacation from December 23rd until today, January 3rd.	
It's tough to come back to work after being gone for ten days, but I think it's tougher to stay home and try to do what my wife does every day, which is work, raise our daughter, keep the house , cook, and everything else.	home PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-1" type="FAC",house PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-3" type="FAC"

I actually don't know if it will be Monday yet, as I didn' twant to ruin Joyce's New Year by giving her the bad news.	
I plan to call her this morning and tell her the total, complete with my rental car for a week.

2005-01-05T15:26:00 The college football season is finally over.	
On one hand, I am a bit sad because years like this only happen for Auburn every 15 or 20 years, so it's a little disappointing.	Auburn PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-3" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" predicative="true" state="US-AL" type="PPL"
On the other hand, this worked out about as well as it could.	
If you asked me at the beginning of the year if I'd rather be 8-3 and playing in the liberty bowl or 12-0 with a chance to win the Sugar Bowl, go 13-0 and finish second, I'd say hell yeah to the latter.	
The fact that pundits put OU ahead of Auburn based on their out of conference schedule being tougher than ours is laughable now.	Auburn PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:114277" id="Pl-3" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" predicative="true" state="US-AL" type="PPL"
In the end, playing Bowling Green over us playing The Citadel didn't make the Sooners much better.	
Man, I've seen softer takedowns on Cops.	
USC came on to the field, gave up a TD, then decided to make Choke-lahoma their collective bitches, and they did just that.	Choke-lahoma PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1103857" id="Pl-10" latLong="35.500°N 97.500°W" state="US-OK" type="CIVIL"
38-10 at the half meant that I didn't even have to hear that dying hyena Ashlee "no, I'm the one with dark hair and no boobs" Simpson butcher yet another song on tv.	
Hell, I read it on Fark this morning.	
Hooray for big first half beatings that get me an extra hour of sleep.	
We might not have won, but we wouldn't have let Leinert go long on us all night either.	
Our db's would have had something to say about that.	
And, it turns out that when playing a decent team, OU can't do shit on offense.	
That was just plain terrible.	
Jason White looked like Jason Voorhees out there, stomping around getting caught from every direction any time he didn't hand of to Peterson for a three yard loss.	
In five years, Oklahoma has played in four huge games, and lost three of them...badly.	Oklahoma PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1103857" id="Pl-12" latLong="35.500°N 97.500°W" state="US-OK" type="CIVIL"
That must feel like being a Sox fan before this year, I'd imagine.	
Anyway, I feel great.	
Think about this.	
A year ago, Tuberville was one reporter's abililty to find an out of place airplane in Ohio away from being fired BEFORE the Alabama game.	Alabama PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780775" id="Pl-13" latLong="32.750°N 86.750°W" predicative="true" state="US-AL" type="CIVIL"
Then, the AD and President get canned, a booster starts down the long road to shun-ville, and Tuberville keeps smiling and saying the right things.	
He talks his two running backs and two stellar DB's into staying, then knocks out 15 straight wins and signs one of those super iron-clad contracts that will pay him 14 million over seven years, and if Auburn even thinks...THINKS about letting him go, they owe him every penny.

I don't even think there's a morality clause.	
He could have sex with an endangered Bald Eagle, and they'd STILL have to pay him.	
And that's the way it should be.	
Meanwhile, Auburn fans can spend the next six months saying "yeah, but we'd have done this" or "We were 13-0, won the sec, beat five top ten teams, three of them on the road, and became the only undefeated SEC team in the BCS's history to NOT play for the title."

You won in 2000, but you got punked the last two years, and last year you got to play for the title even though you didn't even win your conference.	
You got embarassed by Kansas State and LSU last year, and humiliated this year.	Kansas PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:482813" id="Pl-14" latLong="38.500°N 98.500°W" predicative="true" state="US-KS" type="CIVIL"
But the little 12 is SOOO much better than the SEC.	
That's why you played a four-loss team for your conference title this year.	
And, considering the BCS is run by the head of the Big 12, it's no wonder you get the benefit of the doubt.	
Don't think so?	
How about the fact that only two teams that didn't win their conference have ever played for the national title?	
You and Nebraska in 2001.	Nebraska PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780792" id="Pl-15" latLong="41.500°N 99.750°W" state="US-NE" type="CIVIL"
Oh, the other thing you two Big 12 teams have in common is that you got your asses kicked on the sport's biggest stage.	
So yes, we are disappointed.	
But all you can do is play the schedule in front of you.	
Auburn did that with class and dignity, they won every game, faced down every challenge, and made every Auburn fan in the country and the world proud.

2005-01-05T16:32:00 Much like the "I told you so's" everyone is throwing at the UGA basketball program after their hiring and subsequent firing of The Harricks, folks around the Buckeye state have to be having similar thoughts.

Maybe it's me, but I'm guessing Andy's tired of putting on TV makeup and going on the news lying about what he or Tressel knew about their athletes in general and their football program in particular.	
It seems that Maurice Clarrett-gate just isn't going away.	
Two years ago, everyone was saying "shame on you, Maurice.	
You should have known better."	
Now, it seems like most folks are saying "Shame on you both Andy and Jim.	
YOU both should have know better."	
Allegations have come to light that several OSU players received illegal benefits including cash, access to cars, etc.	
Now, I don't expect the AD and coach to know everything, but when a player is driving a brand new car every couple of weeks or months, well, somebody ought to jot a memo and get to the bottom of that.	
It shouldn't surprise Buckeye fans either, since Tressel had similar problems at Youngstown State, and left a wake of controversy behind himself there as well, including (surprise) illegal benefits including cash, cars, grade fixing, etc.	Youngstown PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-6" predicative="true" type="PPL",Buckeye PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1086497" id="Pl-5" latLong="40.250°N 83.000°W" predicative="true" state="US-OH" type="CIVIL"
Geiger is also tired from saying "we didn't do anything wrong" about his basketball program.

Wednesday, Commissioner Gary Bettman announced the cancellation of the 2004-2005 NHL season.	
As if everyone didn't already know that was the case.	
Shame on the NHL and shame on the players' association for not getting a deal done, but I put much more of the blame on the owners as this "negotiation" came down to the wire.	
I understand that the league was losing less money by not playing than it would have by having a season this year.	
I also understand that when push came to shove, the players gave in and accepted a salary cap.	
Okay, the sides were about 7 million per team apart, but couldn't they just say "alright, let's split that in half and play hockey?"	
I mean Holy Christ people, two kids arguing over 10 bucks would work it out that way.	
Why is this any different?	
The NHL's primary goal was to get a salary cap approved by the players, and they finally did.	
And what did the NHL do when that momentus event occurred?	
They left the negotiating table.	
Gary Bettman is a mindless troll and the professional sports commissioner equivalent of Joe Hazelwood and this lockout strike cluster fuck is the reef.	
The first thing that needs to happen is that Bettman and Goodenow (the players' association rep) need to be fired, deported, flogged, tarred and feathered and finally forced to pay for four tickets plus a program, four dogs, four beers, and two cokes and parking to a game at an NHL arena for every day of the next season so they understand what the fans go thru to see a hockey game.	
Then, all current contracts need to be voided by the end of the season in 2006.	
That means no team would own any player, and the owners would be free to sign whomever they'd like using the "fiscal restraint" they all droned on and on about all year.	
That way, they'd only pay as much as they could afford...right?	
Wrong.	
Those douchebags would end up overspending like every professional sports owner because they can't control themselves.	
If Mr. Iginla or Heatley were free agents, for example, owners would bid each other out of their minds, then they'd be left with not enough to get a competetive team.	
While the business model in the NHL was certainly flawed and the owners needed help, they really needed help to protect them from themselves.	
And the fact is that without that help, the owners would follow the same path that got them where they are right now anyway.	
The biggest issue is this, however.	
Very few people give one hot shit whether the NHL plays another game ever, let alone this season or the next one.	
For every crying Canuck there are 1,000 or more others who say "No hockey?	
Huh...didn't even notice."	
And the last television network interested in carrying hockey (ESPN) may opt out of televising the NHL next season, meaning that all of the teams would be in HUGE trouble, because no TV = no league.	
Period.	
Atlanta lost the Flames 25 years ago because, despite full houses every night, it's TV revenue that pays the freight and the Flames had no tv contract.	Atlanta PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:352615" id="Pl-3" latLong="33.749°N 84.388°W" state="GA" type="PPLA"
Imagine an entire league with no TV contract.	
Hell, Major League Soccer and the WNBA DO have a tv contract and no one gives a shit about them.	
I'll say this for the NHL, when they screw up, they screw up huge.	
Congrats guys.	
You will forever be known as the generation that killed professional hockey in North America .	
That'll look GREAT on your resumes.	
 Martha Stewart: Last Day of the "Living" Dead	
2004-12-09T14:01:00 Shares of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia , a company whose name is so breathtakingly self-promoting it makes me long for the days when every single entity involve in real estate or casinos was called Trump, continues to soar; it rose $1.78, or 7.29%, on news that the company's namesake will star in a new TV show once she, er... gets out of prison.	
Now, I know there have been succesful companies that dealt with crooks (Warner Communications, which started as a merger between business in the three most mob-influenced industries around, comes to mind), but it's a gamble and not a business strategy.	
The company's performance wasn't all that hot even before the CEO went to prison, and until very recently the stock price reflected that.	
But this is a one-person company, and at this point it's saying the 'Martha' brand is worth some $1.31 billion.	
If anything, the value of the brand should decline over time, inasmuch as she's rather, well, mortal.	
And she's been convincted of obstruction of justice.	
This runup is based on the inexplicable hope that now that the head of the firm and the embodiment of a much-resented brand is no longer doing time for lying to the Federal government, they'll be able to really coin some money.	
I just don't know what to say.

 Video Rentals: The Three Hypotheses	
2004-12-11T18:45:00 Scrappy underdog Netflix had its day earlier in the year, when it became one of the hottest stocks around (sporting an eye-popping P E in the high 900's on the way up, and, thanks to a poor earnings report, over 1,000 on the way down).	
There's plenty of argument about the future of DVD and video rental, and Netflix represents a pure-play on one of the three dominant hypotheses: I. That business is O-V-E-R -- Between pay-per-view, video-on-demand, pirated movies, high-bandwidth Internet broadcasts, and the increasing availability of other media, it takes some faith to see any future for movie rentals.	
Those who don't have the requisite faith will point to these factors as proof that the business is dying and the movie business in general will need a pretty significant overhaul before it can make profits.	
Movie rentals are no longer a cheap alternative to other ways of viewing films; they're the stodgy, expensive way.	
There aren't any pure-play buys on this theory, but someone who believes it might overweight their portfolio in cable companies -- if they purchased any media stocks at all.	
Of course, there have been companies whose performance would perfectly mimic the validity of this idea, but Psuedo.com failed without producing a single show, and Broadcast.com was swallowed for $6 billion by Yahoo!, to Yahoo!'s great regret.	
II.	
Not so fast -- it'll just go online!	
-- Anyone who wants to counter that argument would probably start by taking us back to 1997, when in terms of time used, text was the most popular kind of information online.	
At the time, and for years after, people argued that the traditional bookstore would become obsolete.	
After all, how could we stand for a rapaciously arborcidal medium like 'books' or 'newspapers' when we could transmit the same data as bits and bytes and save on transportation, too?	
As it turns out, of course, Amazon.com, BarnseandNoble.com, and a host of others simply took the bookstore model, attached a 56K modem, and declared themselves The Future. Netflix is doing much the same thing: Taking the traditional business online to cut costs and boost customer service.	
III.	
Who d'you think you're kidding?	
You can't kill movie rental stores -- So there's a big difference between movies and books: For books, the retail store is practically the sole medium of distribution; if you don't sell through them, books won't get sold.	
For movies, the video rental store is just one way to get videos out there (though at 45-55% of studio revenues, it's a much more important one than people think).	
But given the high valuations ascribed to bricks-and-mortar-and-dead tree booksellers like Barnes and Noble , Borders , and to a much lesser extent Books-A-Million , surely there's room for a Blockbuster , along with a Movie Gallery or two.	
The latter, at least, still has room to grow.	
By focusing on smaller, rural communities (preferably the sort that considers DSL 'newfangled') they're WalMarting WalMart -- competing with Walmart's awful in-store video rentals by offering better selection and much lower prices.	
The movie business is changing dramatically as the potential for online distribution grows, but like every other business it leaves lots of room for traditional operators to operate at traditional (read: high) profits.	
The aggressive bidding war for Hollywood Video , featuring two of their competitors, a buyout shop, and one of the savviest raiders around, is proof that some people still think these stores are worth something.	Hollywood PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1661757" id="Pl-1" latLong="34.098°N 118.326°W" predicative="true" state="US-CA" type="PPL"
And I'm one of them.	
Full Disclosure: For once, I'm actually writing about something I own: I have shares of Movie Gallery, I've suggested it to friends, and I'd be quite thrilled if the stock went up.	
I don't do 'sell targets', but I'd probably hold the stock if it ran up anything less than 50% from this level.	
If I sell, I'll post a notification one trading day beforehand.	
Because Lord knows you care.	
 WalMart: Conglomerating?	
2004-12-12T14:47:00 Conglomerates are a fascinating species: The standard definition is 'a company involved in multiple unrelated businesses' but the more accurate definition would be 'a company that relies on financial pyrotechnics, balance sheet juggling, and adroit accounting to create the illusion of growth'.	
I love to write about them, but I'd hate to own one, since most of their market value comes from the market's assumption that the company's leaders will somehow find a way to retroactively justify their overvaluation.	
Usually, it doesn't work, but when it does the results can be spectacularly entertaining.	
For a while (see Ling-Temco-Vought or Tyco for details).	
The recent rumors about WalMart's plans to buy out a shipping company have given rise to the fear that the company may go the conglomerate route.	
They have many of the symptoms of a late-stage conglomerate: A gigantic main business with slowing growth, fear that competition will substantially reduce the profitability of their main business, a shareholder base that includes many people who own only WalMart stock (thus providing another incentive for intracompany diversification), and enough resources to pull it off on a grand scale.	
I can understand the concerns, but I don't see the motivation.	
As a retailer of just about everything, WalMart can expand into some pretty broadly-defined areas without going beyond either their core competencies or some arenas where they can cut costs.	
After all, adding some international shipping assets to their holdings would be a natural extension of their enormously successful practice of buying the distribution network for their products.	
They're coming close to Smithfield Food's very successful 'squeal to meal' policy; if these rumors are true, the result for shareholders will be a pretty positive one.	
 They're Kidding, Right?	
2004-12-13T07:22:00 So Oracle and Peoplesoft , who spent the last 18 months insulting one another in every imaginable way, are finally tying the knot ?	
The final price, $26.50 per share, beats all the previous bids by a huge margin -- of course, Oracle lowballed their earlier offers, and ended up basically bidding against themselves and the optimism of other Peoplesoft shareholders for a year and a half.	
It's been a pretty grueling fight (was it worth it?	
How much of Peoplesoft's most valuable -- human -- resources will walk out the door the day their options vest?) made all the more so by the widely-held assumption that Larry Ellison was either bluffing or screwing around.	
So it's over.	
I don't have Oracle Peoplesoft's spat to kick around anymore.	
I'll have to stick with condemning the merger as a totally unworkable deal between two sides who absolutely hate each other.	
And I won't dwell on the irony of an Oracle employee being driven out of Oracle, starting his own company, and forcing Ellison to spend $10.3 billion to get his company -- but not him -- back (though it does rather delightfully remind me of Coca-Cola basically giving away the bottling franchise and then spending billions to buy it back).	
Ellison is brilliant enough to make this merger work, but he's crazy enough to wreck even the soundest of deals.	
We shall see.	
 Casino Stock Isn't Quite Blue-Chip	
2004-12-15T21:28:00 Back in the day (2000-2003 or so) some of the hottest non-homebuilding stocks were the gaming equipment manufacturers , who rode a wave of heavy reinvestment in casinos to produce huge profits.	
Now, all that reinvestment has paid off, and, along with a good dose of consolidation, made the industry moderately hot again.	
Like every boom, whether merited or not, the big companies have big moves in the early stage, but it doesn't get attention or turn into a mania until we see a frenetic IPO or two.	
You know where this is going: Las Vegas Sands kicked off its first trading day with a 60% gain after a last-minute increase in offering price to $29 a share, outside the $24-$26 range bandied about after they dropped their first $20-$22 estimate.

But, well, the business is complicated and the business is tough.	
Wynn Resorts , another owner of the lucrative Macau license that captured investors's attention during the IPO, illustrates this well enough: Steve Wynn, the company's founder, made a gigantic fortune when he bet his company's future on Atlantic City .	Atlantic City PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:875413" id="Pl-3" latLong="39.364°N 74.423°W" state="US-NJ" type="PPL",Macau PLACE country="CN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18795905" id="Pl-2" latLong="22.200°N 113.533°E" predicative="true" state="US-NJ" type="CIVIL"
When investors saw his $160 million all-debt investment turn into a $440 million asset in just a few years -- his net worth took a similar, though even less gravitationally-bound arc, rising from $2 million to $75 million durign the same time) they all rushed in.	
Needless to say, Wynn sold when everyone else bought, and he made it through the cannibalizing near-collapse those casinos faced in the early 90's.	
So, applause and cheers all around to the casinos raising such spectacular sums for your broad-scoped ambitions.	
And a premature apology to the newly-minted shareholders, who will doubtless see some eye-popping returns in the right direction for a little while and then face a long road back to the reality that is a price around half the current one.	
Full disclosure, just for the hell of it: I was bearish about the Google IPO, too.

 Yukos's "Mystery Bidder"	
2004-12-19T15:09:00 So far, the Yukos auction has produced more questions than answers, and so far the biggest of the former is just who made off with their prize assets.	
Auctioneers reported a $9.3 billion winning bid for Yuganskneftgaz -- the company's main asset, worth two to three times that amount -- by an anonymous company located in Tver .	Tver PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" id="Pl-1" type="PPL"
Well, sort of.	
It turns out the anonymous company, BaikalFinansGroup, shares an address with OOO Tverneftemash, which was recently bought by ZAO Gazpromgeocomservice, not to ever be confused by the similarly-named Gazprom (which by the way has a similar logo).	Tver PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" id="Pl-1" type="PPL"
Gazprom, of course, is the gigantic, Kremlin-supported gas company most observers assumed would bid for the assets.	
There aren't many groups in Russia who can afford a $9.3 billion bet, particularly when it's such a politically-weighted one.	Russia PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-2" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
Gazprom may have arranged some last-minute debt financing, or might have an outside partner, but I seriously doubt they weren't in some way involved with the company that won the auction.

 Everlast's Rally Just Might Live up to the Name	
2004-12-20T15:37:00 Microscopic microcap Everlast , mainly a maker of boxing equipment, has soared over the last several days thanks to a licensing deal with Jacques Moret allowing Moret to buy out their women's apparel license for $30 million, on top of a $12.5 million payment now.	
In other words, a competitor has decided that one segment of the company's business is potentially worth $42.5 million.	
Investors have prudently valued the remaining business -- the extremely well-known Everlast brand, the possible new reality TV show, and most of the company's assets -- at a negative $16.5 million.	
The company's stock would have to rise more than 50% from the current level to put a zero value on that business.	
And, who knows?	
It might.	
 Krispy Kreme -- At Least we Have Consensus	
2005-01-05T19:01:00 Well, we don't, but we've something very much like it: A company hitting and then rehitting lows that would have been unthinkable even after their pull-back a year ago, accusations and proof of some less-than-Kosher accounting, and, best of all, allegations of egregious self-dealing by insiders.	
A glance at the analyst opinions shows that they have a lone bull cheerleading the stock, and plenty of bears hammering it.	
That's evidence enough that it's underpriced; the market usually reacts to a downgrade by dropping the stock a percent or two, but I can't help it -- I presume most of these downgrades arose from the classic "Well, what does your analyst think?"	
"He says it's a buy," "Well, what's it done this year?" conversation.	
Nobody wants to be caught recommending a loser, and unlike portfolio managers with a Net Asset Value report card every trading day, analysts can essentially start fresh with each new opinion.	
The best analysts get noted, lauded, and showered with cash.	
The worst?	
Well, they're still averaged in with the rest.	
And anyway, I don't consider analysts anything but aggregators of publically-available information and echo-chambers for previously-determined opinions.	
They can't really add much without straying into the realm of inside information, and what they do add is usually factored in the moment the report is released.	
Or, in an ideal world, it should be.	
Thankfully, ours is a less-than-ideal, though by no means dystopic, market, so we get plenty of opportunities to profit from the mistakes of others.	
As long as the bearish opinions of analysts weighs down on Krispy Kreme , I'll be a bull.	
 Not an ordinary earnings miss?	
2005-01-20T16:41:00 eBay 's nauseating $19.72 decline (a loss of 19.14%) has that end-of-an-era feel, like the Motorola crash described in The Money Game or the nadir of the dot.com collapse profiled in Dot.con . There's news, of course (the only time there's no news whatsoever is when the entire market tanks), but missing estimates by a penny and showing some 'red flags' shouldn't be an excuse for lopping off twice as much as the market had the night before (after hours, eBay had lost a modest 10% or so).	
Watching a stock drop after hours, open lower, and close even lower than that makes me wonder just who's selling: a runup usually builds on a gradual crescendo of greater-fool theory -- everyone thinks they can always sell to someone dumber -- and ends when the greatest fool yet gets sick of the whole thing and bails.

 Vioxx: Slightly Bigger Deal than we Thought?	
2005-01-26T07:11:00 Merck posted a 21% decline in earnings thanks to the new post-Vioxx announcement.	
Most of the profit decline was because Vioxx, representing about 11% of sales, now represents a pretty severe legal headache: Not only have they lost the revenue, but they've taken a $600 million charge as a reserve against future Vioxx losses.	
If that's an accurate number, investors should cheer up: Merck's at fifteen times annualized earnings, twelve times forward earnings, and underappreciated by most of Wall Street .	Wall Street PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208991647" id="Pl-1" state="US-NY" type="ROAD"

What they've been missing for years was the real driver behind any consumer economy: Consumers.	
Specifically, they didn't have a real middle class.	
That's changed in the last twenty years, as increasing social mobility and a burst in foreign demand has finally made China a genuine, rather than theoretical, contender.	China PLACE country="CN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18099327" id="Pl-4" latLong="35.000°N 105.000°E" type="COUNTRY"

 Off the hook? Give us a break!	
2005-02-01T07:48:00 Georgia 's Insurance Commissioner, John Oxendine, claims that Marsh 'got off the hook' -- and you can bet he's got a plan to fix that.	Georgia PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1706317" id="Pl-1" latLong="32.750°N 83.500°W" state="US-GA" type="CIVIL"
Perhaps the worst feature of Spitzer's Attila the Hun-like sweep through the financial services industry is his habit of breeding imitators, who will essentially use his settlement as a benchmark for creating their own demands.	
Interestingly enough, this morning's Wall Street Journal reported that Marsh paid a higher fee than they needed to -- that the $850 million number was agreed upon at the last minute mainly so Marsh could pay out over a four-year period without admitting guilt.	Wall Street PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208991647" id="Pl-2" predicative="true" state="US-NY" type="ROAD"
The rhetoric we're hearing -- that Marsh may have cost customers billions of dollars -- doesn't match the reality that in a few cases, they manipulated bids, but that the proven damages thus far involve only a few million dollars of business priced 5% or 10% higher than it otherwise would have been.	
Crazy.	
Full Disclosure: I own shares of Marsh, and I would not be particularly dissapointed if Eliot Spitzer's career took a sudden nosedive thanks to, say, questions about his business relationship to money manager and alleged stock manipulator Jim Cramer.	
Nothing personal; I just think he's the Fifth Horseman of the fiscal apocalypse, representing Irresponsible Investing with Wild Abandon.	
 The Exponentials	
2005-02-04T13:22:00 It's always difficult to get used to a central fact of the modern economy: The best new technology will keep getting better at an absolutely astounding rate.	
Usually, the improvement curve flattens pretty fast -- the usual auto industry computer industry comparison works just fine (According to the standard urban legend, Bill Gates notes that "If we'd been making cars instead of software, you'd get 500 miles to the gallon, need an oil change every 250,000 miles, and be able to replace your car for $200," to which a mythical GM executive replies "Ah, but if Microsoft made cars, they'd crash three times a day, too!").	
Anyway, a few announcements during the last two days underscore the fact that the growth in memory and processing power for computers is far from over: Hewlett-Packard is developing a new replacement for the transistor , and a consortium of software companies is backing a new technology that would allow discs to hold up to a terabyte of information .	
No idea where this will end up: It's not altogether rare that these announcements result in a very expensive project to develop something that, for whatever reason, isn't worthwhile to consumers.	
But it's important to remember that the status quo is never more than a snapshot -- investing as though it's permanent is a recipe for disaster.	
 The "Twin Deficits" Myth	
2005-02-04T13:37:00 According to the usually reliable CNN Money, the "Twin Deficits" will continue to grow . Interesting terminology.	
.. terminology..	
. terminology...	
I believe they're referring to the budget deficit and... the capital surplus?	
When analyzing trade deficits, it's important to realize that the amount by which imports exceed exports is also equal to the net amount foreign investors have bet on the US .	US PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-4" nonLocUse="true" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
So the trade deficit is due to a confluence of the pressures from US consumers (who control about 20% of global GDP) and everybody else (excluding the non-consumption share of US GDP, that would amount to around 75% of global GDP).	US PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-4" nonLocUse="true" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
Which of those is -- probably -- going to be a more important number?	
Even if we are consumers bent on gorging ourselves with imported goods, the largest pressure on the deficit is that we're simply a better place for investment -- higher returns on capital in developing countries are more than mitigated by the higher political risks they face.	
And what about that other deficit?	
It, of course, is the ominous sum that we fund without taxes, but by borrowing funds.	
And about half of those borrowings end up with the major banks in Asia . So, not to be a heretic, but 1) We're issuing them at relatively low interest rates, 2) Inflation is bound to pick up eventually, and so 3) Wouldn't you rather have our deficits made up by economically nonsensical purchases by non- US investors, rather than raising taxes in America ?	America PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" type="COUNTRY",US PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-4" nonLocUse="true" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
It's a question of who will pay for the same spending, and all else being equal I'd be happy for Asian central banks to pick up the tab.	
The Twin Deficits are a reality, but they aren't exactly a terrifying one.	
 NYSE Selling Out? Thank God!	
2005-02-04T17:36:00 The market didn't have an intelligent way to react to this news (except to send NASDAQ , which I've been cheerleading for a while, up 10.46% in sympathy), but the New York Stock Exchange may actually convert to a for-profit entity.	New York PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-1" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" predicative="true" state="US-NY" type="PPL"
It's far too clubby now, and while this move wouldn't get rid of nine-figure paydays, it might ensure that they only happen when well-deserved.	
Not to name names or anything.	
The exchange needs this: it's ossified, the real owners -- holders of exchange seats -- have seen their investment lose 40% in a year (though they can still earn an income from it to offset the losses), and the NASDAQ has undercut their traditional dominance among growth companies-turned-blue chips.	
Heck, they're down to just over half of their single-letter symbols !	
It's a dying organization, and this will be just the jolt it needs for another couple decades of somnambulant staggering before being ultimately replaced by far more efficient companies.	
Full Disclosure: "Far more efficient companies," basically means "The NASDAQ," so take it with a gigantic grain of salt.	
Secondary Disclosure: You can take the above at face value; I don't own stock in a salt company.

Well, I'm not sure how I take the NYSE news.	
I think I agree with you on the wreckless compensation thing.	
I also think that Sears-Kmart should come up with a new name altogether.	
Those stores are deadzones, and they need some buzz.	
Change the names, paint the buildings, reorganize a little, and hire strippers for cashiers.	
I'm not sure how that last idea got in there.

 Nostalgia Alert	
2005-02-05T13:58:00 I really miss the days when a major international oil company could basically buy some tiny, ill-established foreign government to get at its natural resources.	
We've progressed a bit since then: Now, the third world countries all have their own state oil companies, who are picking apart the carcasses of once-private concerns.	
The Capital Spectator reports on the latest: Not only China , but India 's state oil company has decided to get into the Yukos-dismemberment trade .

 Gmail: Cachet for Everybody!	
2005-02-06T19:51:00 At first, I was pretty skeptical of Gmail -- an announcement of something new, cool, and free, from a quirky company, on April Fool's Day?	
Turns out my initial attitude wasn't justified, of course, and Gmail has been a popular success.	
Just this weekend, Google gave many users another fifty invitations , prompting some to speculate that it could be the start of Gmail's final move out of beta.	
Their marketing was absolutely brilliant: Simply through association with Google, and because of the invitation-only membership, they created a product with instant cachet -- something so in demand invitations went for $50 on eBay, and one enterprising site even offered a kidney for an invite.	
And now?	
Everyone who wants a Gmail account has one, and yet people with invites have an almost pathological desire to give them away.	
It's been nearly a year, the service is nearly ubiquitous, and somehow Google has kept us obsessed with Gmail.	
Want an invite?	
I've got a dozen.

2005-02-06T20:09:00 Frenetic merger and acquisition activity doesn't mean much in the early days of a business -- it's just as likely that ridiculously overfunded startups are buying out their bankrupt competitors to create larger and less stable conglomerates as it is that forward-thinking visionaries are cutting off their competitors early.	
But when an outsider buys into the business once it's established itself as important, but before it's really gotten profitable, it's big news.	
For now, it's just a rumor that Ask Jeeves is buying Bloglines .	
I'd keep an eye on this -- if Ask Jeeves pops on the news, the easy money from the blogging trend is already gone.

 Yukos Update: All Previous Yukos Updates Wrong	
2005-02-07T07:46:00 Apparently Yuganskneftegaz, which was sold to an independent buyer who turned out to be an apparatus of the state (yes, the same state that 1) forced Yukos to do the auction, and 2) ran the auction, not that 3) this is suspicious or anything), and which was then being bought with foreign assistance, is not being bought with foreign assistance.	 
As of this morning, at least.	 
Anyway, it looks like they're denying Chinese involvement to avoid a lawsuit , which is funny -- you'd think they might know someone in the Russian judiciary who could help them out.	 ,Russian PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-2" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY",Chinese PLACE country="CN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18099327" id="Pl-1" latLong="35.000°N 105.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
 Cisco's Indication	
2005-02-08T20:33:00 Today's performance said a lot about how the market viewed certain subjects; tomorrow's will tell us even more.	
Today, Ask Jeeves made their official announcement about acquiring Bloglines.	
And tonight, Cisco reported solid earnings and weak sales .	
The market's modestly pessimistic reaction to the Bloglines news tells us that blogging isn't seen as a major profit source yet; tomorrow's trading will tell us whether the market is ready to accept that more established technology businesses are back on track as well.	
After hours, Cisco's been slammed, but once they're exposed to the rest of the trading population, the results might differ.

T09:29:00 I don't think bloglines will ever be a major source of profits or revenues.	
Blogging itself could become a pretty big consumer past time like watching TV, reading a book, or playing video games but I am not sure how bloglines really benefits.	
I would guess it most benefits the search engines, hit counters, and software builders.	
With the explosion in available market commentary that happened through the internet it is not clear to me that by lowering the costs of access blogging really adds that much as much as it did to political commentary.	
Maybe Seeking Alpha can become the new TSCM but I don't think that will change the landscape as much as Howard Dean's campaign did.	
 Poliblogs versus Stockblogs	
2005-02-08T20:59:00 Stephen of IRA-CAM is experiencing Sitemeter envy over all those succesful political blogs.	
Understandable!	
After all, my biggest surge in hits came from a link from, well, a political blog.	
However, I'd rather not worry -- instead, I'd like to think of our situation as akin to Instapundit , or Andrew Sullivan , or Daily Kos in, say, the summer of 2001.	
Blogs didn't get huge until people saw them updated continuously on September 11th, and during the primaries, and later on during the conventions.	
In politics, there's a definite four-year cycle, and any new medium can find its voice and carve out an audience in that time.	
Financial markets aren't so kind.	
In short, we need a crash, and we need to blog it. jult52 ?

T23:24:00 I can understand that.	
When you're blogging about stocks, it's possible -- though a little difficult -- to say "Okay, you're right, I'm wrong.	
So I'm going to sell what I had, and sell it short!"	
And everyone can be reasonably happy.	
But a political blog is usually built around a certain ideology, and no matter how compelling you are, you probably won't change anyone's stated opinions (Instant Counterpoint: Check Little Green Footballs now, and compare that to the September 11th archive).	
 Sirius Satellite -- Brilliant Plan, or Grasping at Straws?	
2005-02-09T19:23:00 Mel Karmazin is pushing to add Sirius Satellite services to iPods -- an interesting idea, inasmuch as it seems to defeat the purpose of both.	
The iPod's the tiniest possible container for vast music libraries, and Sirius is a way to get at lots of content when said music library is unavailable.	
On the other hand, Karmazin and Jobs are two of the smartest dealmakers around, so they might find a way to structure this or spin it to the benefit of everyone.	
My main suspicion is that this is Karmazin hoping to see the phrase "Mel Karmazin, CEO ["That's right," Mel says to himself, "C-E-friggin- O !"] of Sirius Satellite Radio..." ira-cam ?

He could get people to ignore every single technical obstacle to an idea, and invest on the basis of something beautifully, but ridiculously, simple.	
Basically, he sells the future; the iPod and the Mac Mini are just times he got lucky and the future caught up. jontait ??

 Out come the long knives	
2005-02-10T21:38:00 Apparently Carly made a lot of journalistic enemies during her six hears at HP.	
Not only was the catalyst for her fall from grace a Fortune article by Carol Loomis (who as far as I know is immortal -- she's been writing for Fortune since 1954), but the anti-Carly brigades are out in full force at Salon.com .	
This is getting a little harsh; she might have messed up at HP (I refuse to call it by the new name, for now), but she wasn't actively trying to destroy a great company and wreck the shareholders.	
It just, well, happened.	
So, right, Carly was a bad manager, and she eventually got what she deserved, but she isn't evil incarnate.

 Joe Granville's Still At It	
2005-02-12T17:17:00 Joseph Granville, the octogenarian technical analyst, has predicted a precipitous decline in stock prices this year .	
I'm a little bearish, myself (it always helps), but I've taken the liberty of checking some alternate sources for Granville information , from which I get the following incident: Granville's behavior easily attracted public attention.	
His investment seminars were bizarre extravaganzas, sometimes featuring a trained chimpanzee who could play Granville's theme song, "The Bagholder's Blues," on a piano.	
He once showed up at an investment seminar dressed as Moses, wearing a crown and carrying tablets.	
Granville made extravagant claims for his forecasting ability.	
He said he could forecast earthquakes and once claimed to have predicted six of the past seven major world quakes.	
He was quoted by Time magazine as saying, "I don't think that I will ever make a serious mistake in the stock market for the rest of my life," and he predicted that he would win the Nobel Prize in economics . Sounds like a paragon of stability and common sense to me!	
 Verizon MCI -- That's all, folks!	
2005-02-14T21:15:00 I was hoping for another incredibly drawn-out story, full of antitrust drama, lurking potential bidders, and contentious confrontations between executives.	
And then MCI just sort of accepted a Verizon deal without really bothering anybody . Clearly, their corporate culture has suffered -- 25 years ago, MCI was the brawling upstart in the telecom industry, constantly challenging AT&amp;T's right to exist, much less to monopolize the phone system.	
And now, they're swallowed by Just Another Monolith.	
I expected better -- meaner and tougher, sure, but better nonetheless.	
 G's Investing -- Greenspan and Star Wars	
2005-02-15T18:58:00 G's Investing argues that Alan Greenspan is a George Lucas-esque figure : In the Star Wars universe of George Lucas, he portrays a benevolent dictatorship (or benevolent monarchy) as being superior to a democracy, with the democracy being the system rife with bureaucracy and bloat.	
With Greenspan's unspoken position as economic czar, that's what we have right now: a benevolent dictatorship of the Fed.	
But one of the why dictatorships are so inferior to democracies is that democracy offers a stable, peaceful transfer of power.	
Will we have that at the Fed, when Greenspan leaves Indeed. muckdog ?

The battle is now for the endorsement of Sir Alan Greenspan.	
Where will Dr. Greenshades come down in this debate?	
What will he say on privatization and the associated costs with implementing such a system?	
I think that'll have a pretty big impact on what happens next.

So I'll just note that I don't see it as quite so black-and-white, and I think some of the compromises (like reducing taxes for parents, on the grounds that children are the assets backing Social Security) might be useful and -- we are dealing with a win-or-lose, vote-or-not situation -- practical. muckdog ?

 Northshore Management Update	
2005-02-16T21:20:00 Northshore Management, the hedge fund firm accused of stealing millions of dollars in client funds, is now facing actual SEC action .	
The amount in question: $37 million.	
While it's not a major sum compared to the amounts consider before (as high as $90 million), it's good to see that the issue's getting resolved.	
Though, of course, there's always the chance that these fund managers were stupid and shortsighted, not actually criminal; apparently, the money stolen was lent to or invested in companies the managers controlled -- so they're guilty of front-running, at the least.	
But they might have been using Northshore as an alternative source of capital: Having invested all they could risk, it would only make sense to turn to other sources.	
What we'll need to look for in the coming weeks are 1) What happened to the money once it was invested in these companies (were they real companies, or just avenues for stolen funds?) and 2) How much of this was disclosed beforehand.	
 An Airline Passenger's Bill of Rights?	
2005-02-17T21:15:00 Has the EU once again lost its mind?

It's a great summary of the paradoxes of the Russian economy: They have a huge untapped supply of valuable IT labor, but their IT exports are only a tenth of their military exports (and only a thirtieth of India 's IT exports).

They develop lots of new technology, but nobody can tell who owns what.	
And, of course, their securities laws and property rights are even flimsier than China 's -- after the Putin administration mugged Yukos on the grounds that it was too attractive a target to leave alone, they lost a lot of trust.

Still, they have an unbelieveable amount of untapped potential.	
 The stock-driven prognosis	
2005-02-22T19:19:00 I can think of only one good reason to be this enthusiastic about Martha Stewart Living : The fact that so many investors are so clearly enthusiastic about Martha Stewart Living .	
Let's be clear: There are few worse times to buy a stock than when the namesake and guiding force behind the company is in prison (whether or not she really should be), advertising is down by nearly half, and the brand has been tarnished beyond recognition.	
And yet the stock's within a few points of an all-time high.	
Wonders never cease.	
 Khodorkovsky denies guilt	
2005-02-25T05:41:00 Well, I would, too.	
On the other hand, the Russian legal system is a bit less, well, legalistic -- they seem much more concerned about the chance that someone will harm the state than about actual matters of right and wrong.

 Choicepoint's biggest screwup	
2005-02-26T13:07:00 We all know by now that Choicepoint allowed some highly respectable Nigerian businessmen of impeccable credentials to view hundreds of thousands of customer records for entirely legitimate purposes -- they were paying customers, after all, and The Customer is Always Right.	Nigerian PLACE country="NG" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17979109" id="Pl-1" latLong="10.000°N 8.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
But even after that huge mistake -- or rather, because of it -- the company's top executives began dumping shares like mad . What's scary is that since they started selling, the stock's down about 5%.	
Clearly, they were expecting lots more damage.	
These insider sales were certainly stupid, and probably criminal (though the legal proof may be hard to come by) but the solution is easy enough: They need to buy stock from the company itself, at some premium to the prices at which they sold -- they'll have the same stake as before, the shareholders would have gotten their money back (since the premium goes to the company, which is owned by the shareholders), and there's no need to disrupt their business by taking the matter to court.	
Or, if you want to do things the SEC's way, you could 1) Hire a bunch of lawyers with the company's (shareholders') money, 2) Hire a legion of PR firms to explain away that frivolous spending, 3) Hire a new accountant to magically turn that spending into an investment amortizable over twenty years, and 4) Settle out-of-court by having the execs give the SEC some pittance (for which they'll likely be compensated by the company) and a statement that "We neither admit nor deny that we did what you claim, but we'll never do it again." Thank God for the SEC -- they've practically made it a shareholder's utopia , here.	
 Southern states considering higher cigarette taxes?	
2005-02-26T14:44:00 Good plan; cigarettes impose pretty high penalties on states, inasmuch as the states are caretakers for plenty of people who are ill thanks to cigarettes.	
What's notable in this debate, however, is that according to MSN Moneycentral , tobacco executives are attacking the tax by noting that "While North Carolina 's excise tax is only 5 cents, the total taxes given to North Carolina by smokers adds up to more than 61 cents per pack."	North Carolina PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1028616" id="Pl-3" latLong="35.501°N 80.001°W" state="NC" type="CIVIL"
Okay, okay -- since the tobacco companies pay lots of money to the states, that's technically accurate.	
But the point of these taxes is to align the price of a pack with the cost to society, and inasmuch as these penalties aren't assessed on a per-pack basis, they don't -- they're a lump-sum reflection of the taxes these companies ought to have paid before.	
Interestingly, the policy of making cigarette buyers pay to compensate society for the costs they impose is a politically palatable synthesis of the unpalatable notion of simply refusing treatment unless they pay full cost.	
They're basically buying future medical care throughout their lives, rather than eventually making the (healthy) remainder of the populace pay up.	
In short: Good plan.	
 Icahn's back!	
2005-02-28T22:11:00 You'd think he was busy enough with Blockbuster and Hollywood , but Carl Icahn is once again going after Mylan labs . I'd love to call it a classic raid -- he's making an offer for the company, nominating his own board, claiming management can accept one or the other or both, and hinting that if they paid him enough, he'd probably go away.	Hollywood PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1661757" id="Pl-1" latLong="34.098°N 118.326°W" state="US-CA" type="PPL"
But the whole point of raiding is to outsmart an opponent, and that means the strategy changes constantly.	
In this case, the most interesting twist is that he's shorting shares of Mylan's acquisition target, King Pharmaceuticals; he's basically doubling down on the bet that they won't acquire.	
Not only that, but if Mylan bought him out, they'd have less money to fund a purchase of King Pharmaceuticals.	
Either way, he's showing a lot of confidence.	
Given his record, it's warranted.	
 Yuganskneftegaz to be spun off from Rosneft	
2005-03-02T12:07:00 After being stolen from Yukos, Yuganskneftegaz will be spun off from Rosneft, which will then be sold to Gazprom .	
So far, what we've seen is that 1) An asset was owned by the state , 2) It was sold for a ridiculously low price, 3) It was stolen back by the state , and 4) Now it's being shuffled around among various state -owned and state -influenced companies.	state PLACE country="RU" form="NOM" id="Pl-6"

2005-03-06T22:18:00 The FTC has issued an injunction against Blockbuster to halt their attempted buyout of Movie Gallery , which shouldn't surprise anyone.	
Of course, how it's anticompetitive for the members of a dying corner of a vibrant industry to hook up is beyond me: Clearly, among all the alternative sources for films, movie rental stores are on the way out.	
I'm tempted to predict that this will all be rendered moot, either by a higher bid from Movie Gallery or by the industry changing fast enough that nobody cares.* *And TheStreet.com has a dyslexic price for Movie Gallery -- it's $23.46, no $26.

 The story that refuses to end	
2005-04-01T12:41:00 MCI has repoened their merger talks with Qwest .	
I still don't know where this deal will end up -- as I said a while ago, Verizon raised their bid, but for now the disparity between the two is so high that it's hard to justify the board's decision (particularly, for those of you in the Verizon-is-more-stable camp, because someone who feels that way can sell the MCI stock they get and buy Verizon, cancelling out that particular negative consequence at a minimal cost).

T22:38:00 Actually, I'm beginning to feel that way as well.	
And I've been in the Verizon MCI camp for quite awhile here.	
It's more than just disparity between the two deals, however.	
It really becomes how much premium should one pay for these assets coming out of bankrupcy.	
As the bidding gets higher the risk of the deal actually working increases.	
Qwest is playing a very risky game here, but from a position of desparation.	
Verizon could absorb a deal that didn't totally work out, but why should they take risk by paying more for it?	
They might see themselves five years from now buying the COMBINED entity for less.	
For investors at this point, I'd just take the money and run.	
Or as you say, take the money and just buy Verizon with it (I'd think about doing a pairs trade on this one).	
My sense is that Qwest will win because they feel they have no other choice-- and can get the financing.	
Then we will see whether they can skirt bankruptcy themselves..

 The Pain of Childbirth	
Thu, 20 Jan 2005 10:04:19 +0100 The Pain of Childbirth I have 2 girls already, nearly 8 and 4.5 yrs and I have always said I will NEVER forget the pain of childbirth.	 
Abby was a true water birth (3kg - normal) and with Fiona I was dragged out of the pool after the head crowned (gyno had written on my notes she was 4kg (large) and that she was not to be born in the water (long painful story!	 
) I can still remember though the pain I felt.	 
I am on the large side but I am so worried about how I'm going to cope with a natural childbirth without a pool (not available round here).	 
I've seen videos and heard of ladies who have "managed" their pain control.	 
How in Heavens name can you do that?	 
I've been there; I know what the pain feels like!!	 
Can anyone give me advice or let me know of any techniques which might be able to help?	 
Thanks in advance.

Unassisted or midwife attended?	 
I understand hypnobirthing can be very helpful.	 
I am not pursuing it because I was able to go inside the pain to the good place without training, last time.	 
I have not been thinking much about the hard part of labor prior to getting so close.	 
Now I remember how intense it is.	 
I think I am still looking forward to it more than fearing it, but hey.	 
It's a really intense, vulnerable thing.	 
-- Dagny Welches Thu, 20 Jan 2005 15:52:49 GMT Re: The Pain of Childbirth If you go for a home birth you can rent a birthing pool.	 
I wouldn't necessaritly say that you will have a repeat labour!	 
My first labour I was 30 hours and had an epidural after 22 hours.	 
#2 I went in saying "give me the epidural asap-and never got to the state where I felt that I needed it.	 
Only had tens and gas-and-air.	 
So don't give up on the idea of a natural birth because last time was painful.	 
I think different people different labours are different, so just because one person says "I did *** and it didn't hurt a bit" doesn't mean that it will work for someone else, so going in with a set of suggestions, and being prepared to try them and see which is the best is probably the most helpful.	 
(Oh and "it didn't hurt a bit" is usually helped by mummy amnesia!!;-P) Debbie

Eliyahu Rooff Mon, 06 Dec 2004 10:02:57 -0500 Re: waiver of extradition means what The waiver of extradition that she signed simply means that if she skips out and goes to another state, she can't contest the right of the original court to have her hauled back to its jurisdiction, and that the court won't have to initiate the time-consuming process of extraditing her.	
Instead, if the cops pick her up, she can be shipped back without delay.

This is what happens when people blow off the chances they are given to straighten out by being given probation.	
Thumb your nose at the court often enough, and they will bring all sorts of crap down on your head, re-instituting the original suspended sentences and possibly adding on for the FTA.	
What is it GOOD for?	
It's good for the STATE, not for the convict.	
It lets them skip some of the legal procedures she would otherwise be entitled to, in order to ship her from one state to another.	
But they were entitled to demand that waiver as a condition of probation; if she had not agreed to voluntarily waive that right, they probably would have just thrown her in jail for the 3 year sentence the first time around and she wouldn't have been given the chance to go straight during probation and avoid jail altogether.	
She doesn't have a lot of leeway here.	
She has done this numerous times and they are not likely to give her another wide open chance like they did the first 3 times.	
She will probably have to serve out her sentence in FL , AND if she has not already served all her time in AZ , they will then ship her back there to do THAT time.

On the fourth day of his stay, he was moved out of the ICU to the step-down unit , with a diagnosis of " ICU Psychosis secondary to narcotic administration" and post thoracostomy."	 
He was confused, because of the medication but was not aggressive or threatening in any manner.	 
I saw him each day and as soon as we spoke, he became oriented and was perfectly fine.	 
This was witnessed by both the nursing staff and his doctors.	 
During the early evening hours of his sixth hospital day, he got up, dressed, pulled his chest tube out and managed to get out of the hospital and across four lanes of busy evening traffic, to our apartment .	 
By the time he got to our home , he was very short of breath and there was a nurse and orderly who told me "he's crazy and just walked out."	 
I sat him down on the couch and talked to him, and asked him what had happened.	 
He said he'd asked for something for pain and they told hime he couldn't have anything.	 
Then the orderly was apparently rude to him, and that's when he got up and decided to come home.	 
A short time later, two police officers showed up and told me they had to take him back to the hospital .	 
He went back with the officers, gave them no problems at all.	 
I received a call from the shift supervisor who told me they'd replaced his chest tube, given him some pain medication and he was doing much better.	 
I told her to pass on the other shifts that if he became confused or upset to call me, and I'd talk to him, and get him settled down.	 
At 2:15 the next morning, I received a call from the night shift supervisor who told me my friend had been "verbally abusive and aggressive" and would I come over and talk to him.	 
So, I went over there, getting to his room right at 2:30.	 
There were two cops there and I asked what had happened.	 
My roommate was in bed, sound asleep, and had all of his clothes on.	 
A nurse said, "He beat two of us up.	 
The cops are here because we're pressing charges."	 
I've lived with this man 9 years and never in that time have I ever seen him be aggressive, violent or abusive in anyway.	 
I asked to speak to the two nurses whom he'd alledgedly hit and was told I couldn't do that.	 
An hour or so passed and the got my roommate out of bed, took his chest tube out and discharged him.	 
He was sent to another hospital with a psych unit until his psychosis resolved.	 
I was given copies of a citation for simple assault and battery, then went to the police station several days later to find out what other paperwork was available on this incident.	 
I was given a copy of a different citation, but with the identical information from the one I'd gotten the night of the incident.	 
The police report has the victim saying she was "choked to where she almost lost consciousness, struck in the face with a belt buckle and it had left large marks, and that he'd grabbed her breasts and left marks.	 
According to the police report, this woman never reported to the ER for verification of the injuries and no one else can verify exactly what happened to provoke this incident.	 
My roommate has no recollection of the time from the day before the incident happened until he woke up at the other hospital .	 
He was cited for simple assault and battery.	 
If there is no evidence, and that includes the belt buckle, how can the county prosecute this case.	 
? case.?	 
All of his belongings were returned to me upon his discharge, with the exception of the belt buckle.	 
The police do not have it and the hospital doesn't know what happened to it.	 
Also, I was looking at both citations, I didn't get to the hospital until 2:30 am, and the officer has the time of incident as being at 2:34 am.	 
Does anyone besides me see a problem with any of this?	 
What kind of recourse does my roommate have in all of this?

You are not going to be able to poke holes in this case with Internet advice.	 
In addition, I's suggest raising the stakes.	 
The hospital obviously knew that your friend was having head problems, and they improperly treated him by not sending him to a psych ward, which allowed the situation to get worse until the point where he assaulted someone.	 
Sue them for malpractice, and make the number big enough to get some serious attention. -john- -- ============================== ============================== ========== John A. Weeks III 952-432-2708 j..

If your roommate cannot afford one, contact your roommate's parents about paying for one, or ask about getting a court appointed lawyer.	 
Tell the lawyer that you will help with the case (do administrative stuff, etc) in any way that would help him her defend your roommate.	 
 punshed twice for the same crime	
Wed, 02 Mar 2005 18:11:02 -0500 punshed twice for the same crime I belive I am being punished twice for the same crime.	
Im 29 years old.	
From 18-22 I did some stupid stuff.	
I am not a felon, but I have about 15 non-violent misdemeanors.	
10 of them are driving without a license.	
A two possession of marijuana, two disorderly conduct and a public indecency.	
Since 22 I went to college and exceled at my studies.	
I partipated in my education, and I am trying hard to be an asset to society instead of a liability.	
I cant find a job now.	
Twice I have been offered a job where I would have paid more a year in taxes than my father has ever earned in a year.	
Both offers have been withdrawn after the background check.	
Ive been able to get work as an independent contractor ( software development ), but I've had had to do minimum wage labor for periods of time.	
I was punished for these crimes.	
I have nothing outstanding with the courts.	
I have performed all restitutions and civic sanctions.	
The judge never sentenced me to exclusion from economic prosperity.	
But the court has punished me a second time by publicly tagging labels on me for the rest of my life.	
I went to the judge and told him about the situation.	
He said I have to explain to the potential employer that I have changed and hope they give me a chance.	
Thats kind of hard when you never get to talk to the people who decide whether to hire you or not.	
I'm not trying to excuse what I've done.	
My actions were adolecent and ignorant.	
But I've paid my debt, and would like to get on with my life.	
Am I being punished twice? wt

The simple and wisest action is to assume that they do have a small number and are working feverishly to build a bigger arsenal.	
Now the nut of the question should be, What if Iran gives, sells, provides nuclear weapons to Islamic extremists to smuggle into the United States and at 10 AM on a Wednesday pop 2 or 3 in New York City , destroying Wall street , the large banks, the large Insurance companies, the large sock brokerage houses and many other world wide financial institutions.

No more government payments for federal employees.	
No more government payments for aid to schools, environment, police, courts, Well fare, etc.

With a worthless dollar the amount of fuel available is not cut by 80%.	
No more cheap imports of clothes, boots, appliances, computer stuff, communications equipment, generators, electric motors Cars, Trucks etc.	
Massive unemployment as we are now in a service economy with nothing to service.	
Does the word TEOTWAWKI have any meaning.	
Oh I expect to things to hang together for a few weeks as local, county, and state governments try to hold things together, but they won't.

With out fuel to move imported stuff (most of what we buy these days) from the ports of entry to local warehouses and local retailer shelves of items like building materials, tools, and every thing else we buy the shelves will be empty in a month or so.

 Capital Gains on House after divorce	
Mon, 07 Mar 2005 12:04:48 -0000 Capital Gains on House after divorce I and my ex jointly bought the house in 1998 for $220,000 in California .

We lived in the house since then.	house PLACE country="US" id="Pl-115" state="ca" type="FAC"
We started divorce proceedings in 2004 and my wife moved out.	
Current value of the house is 540,000.	house PLACE country="US" id="Pl-115" state="ca" type="FAC"
I had to pay her, by refinancing my mortgage, half the current property value minus loan remaining which came to about 200,000. i.e [ (540k - 140k) 2 ] .	
She did not pay any taxes for that.	
Now I understand if I sell the house I am stuck with a capital gains tax as a single person on the entire gain !!! i.e 540k-220k = 320 K as the limit is only 250K ?	house PLACE country="US" id="Pl-115" state="ca" type="FAC"
This does not look fair, as my cost basis should be readjusted when I paid my ex half the value 200K !!!	
My real gain is much less.

Sounds wrong to me: Your cost basis should be adjusted to reflect the additional $200,000 -- which you paid to your wife, for her share of the house .	house PLACE country="US" id="Pl-115" state="ca" type="FAC"
And you should certainly also include the original $110,000 (your share of the $220,000), which means your correct cost basis is now about $310,000.	
So if you sell for $540,000, your gain would be $230,000 -- and therefore free of any tax obligation, under current law.	
Of course, there may be other additions to the cost basis which you haven't included -- such as significant home improvements, like a room addition or remodeling of the kitchen.	home PLACE country="US" id="Pl-112" state="ca" type="FAC"
Those would also be added into _your_ basis.	
I've only dealt with the figures you provided.

Utterback, EA Wed, 09 Mar 2005 23:17:54 -0000 Re: Capital Gains on House after divorce There are a few WRONG answers being posted on this subject so I thought I would expand on my original answer and give the OP some authority.	
Under Code Section 1041, any transfer of property between spouses during marriage or any transfer of property between former spouses incident to a divorce is treated as a gift.	
Because these transfers are treated as gifts, the transferee spouse may exclude the property received from his gross income under Code Section 102(a).	
The transferee spouse's basis in the property received for all purposes is the transferor's adjusted basis immediately before the transfer.	
Code Section 1041(b)(2).	
This carryover basis rule applies whether the adjusted basis of the transferred property is less than, equal to, or greater than its fair market value at the time of the transfer, regardless of the value of any consideration provided by the transferee, and applies for purposes of determining loss as well as gain on the subsequent disposition of the property by the transferee.	
Reg. Section 1.1041-1T(d), Code Section 1041 is not elective.	
It applies whether the transfer is for relinquishment of marital rights, for cash or other property, for the assumption of liabilities in excess of basis, or for other consideration, and is intended to apply to any indebtedness that is discharged.	
Reg. Section 1.	
1041-1T(d). 1.1041-1T(d).	
Even if the transfer is a bona fide sale, the transferor does not recognize gain or loss, and the transferee does not acquire a new cost basis in the transferred property.	
Reg. Section 1.	
1041-1T(a) Code Section 1041 applies regardless of whether the transfer is of property separately owned by the transferor or is a division (equal or unequal) of community property.	
Further, Code Section 1041 applies even if the transferred property is subject to liabilities that exceed the adjusted basis of the property.	
Reg. Section 1.1041-1T(d), EXAMPLE: Andy owns property having a fair market value of $10,000 and an adjusted basis of $1,000.	
In contemplation of making a transfer incident to a divorce from Becky, Andy borrows $5,000 from a bank, using the property as security for the borrowing.	
Andy then transfers the property to Becky and Becky assumes, or takes the property subject to, the liability to pay the $5,000 debt.	
Under Code Section 1041, Andy recognizes no gain or loss on the transfer of the property, and Becky's adjusted basis in the property is $1,000.	
Code Section 1041 also applies to transfers of property incident to a divorce.	
Code Section 1041(a)(2).	
A transfer of property is incident to a divorce if it occurs within one year after the date on which the marriage ceases or is related to the cessation of the marriage.	
A transfer is treated as related to the cessation of the marriage if the transfer is pursuant to a or separation instrument and the transfer occurs not more than six years after the date on which the marriage ceases.	
A divorce or separation instrument includes a modification or amendment to a decree or instrument.	
Reg. Section 1.

But if he was required to list the shares in bankruptcy filings, and didn't, the answer may be different.	
I think, though, that any transaction after the bankruptcy filing date is part of his new life.

Was the trustee informed of the transfer of the shares?	
Since you gave your uncle the shares prior to his discharge, the shares should have become assets available to the bankruptcy estate for the satisfaction of debts.	
If the share transfer was reported to the trustee and the trustee did nothing about them, then you may be ok; however, if you failed to inform the trustee, then your uncle may be liable for hiding assets, which would, at the minimum, invalidate his discharge.	
Even if the transfer doesn't invalidate the whole discharge, the distribution might be subject to forfeiture to pay creditors' claims if you failed to inform the trustee of the share transfer.	
You need to speak to a bankruptcy attorney pronto; this is a bankruptcy matter, not a tax matter.	
superprimen...@gmail.com 18 Feb 2005 10:49:15 -0800 Re: S Corp Profit distribution and Bankrupcy. the bankrupcy filing took place in 2003, but it didnt clear until early 2004 and that was when i gave him the shares.	
He had no shares in 2003.	
Shyster1040 Fri, 18 Feb 2005 14:21:23 -0500 Re: S Corp Profit distribution and Bankrupcy.	
Yes, but according to the facts you first gave, he had not yet received the bankruptcy discharge when you gave him the shares.	
I believe you had said that you gave him the shares in February 2004 but that the discharge didn't come until June of 2004.	
That means that he received the shares while he was still in bankruptcy, which means that the shares were potentially assets that the trustee could use to pay off creditors.	
A bankruptcy case doesn't close until you get the discharge order, and until then everything that the debtor receives is fair game for the trustee.	
If the trustee was informed of the shares and did nothing about it, you are more likely than not ok, but if the trustee wasn't informed of the fact directly, then you may be in trouble.	
If, however, your uncle received the shares after he obtained an order of discharge from the bankruptcy court, then as a general matter the creditors cannot go after the shares, unless they can prove that there was collusion between you and your uncle to hide his assets from them (e.g., by putting his assets in the corporation's name and then waiting until after the bankruptcy to transfer the shares to him).

2003 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE WASHINGTON _ Having punched through severely depleted Republican Guard divisions that formed Baghdad 's outer defensive ring, U.S. Army and Marine forces are likely to pause again to test the Iraqi capital 's inner defenses and waall but evaporated under the weight of the U.S. assault.

Their collapse left the U.S. troops less than 20 miles from Saddam Hussein's capital . Bet`fow Central Command chief Gen. Tommy Franks and his field commanders face a big decision _ whether to rush into the city of 5 million where Hussein's regime has gathered its most-trusted forces or wait and see if the war can be won without paying the price of street-to-street urban fighting.	capital PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-35" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC",city PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-58" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC",U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-8" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
``We are expectingn or at least planning for, a very difficult fight ahead,'' Gen. Stanley McChrystal said at the Pentagon Tuesday.	
``We are not expecting to drive into Baghdad suddenly and seize it.''

Thousands of refugees have fled the city , apparently providing information to the British that has led to raids on military and Baath Party sites in the city . ``The key endgame may be whether the U.S. can parse out the key regime centers of power in Baghdad and attack them without having to fight into the city , or at least locate them well enough to atman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in his daily war report.

U.S. strategists say that Hussein, if he is still alive and in control of his forces, might like a bloody battle in Baghdad because such fighting could cause heavy U.S. casualties.

His last hope for survival might be that the United States loses its taste for such losses and forces President Bush to negotiate a compromise that would allow Hussein and his family to keep power in Baghdad .

But Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution in Washington said the apparent collapse of Republican Guard resistance could deprive Hussein of much of the wallop he was counting on in the city . ``If U.S. forces seriously degrade Iraq 's half-dozen Republican Guard divisions before that final battle, and only have to face perhaps 30,000 Special Republican Guard, fedayeen, and related personnel, the task will not be as hard as it might have been,'' he said.

This shows the Iraqi military's growing weakness, he said.

``The Republican Guard has taken a massive hammering at every level and is now scattered and deploying somewhat erratically at the brigade level,'' he said.	
The Iraqis still haven't used chemical weapons, even though many experts feared such attacks as the U.S. troops neared Baghdad . Korb, who's convinced Hussein has stocks of chemical weapons he never reported to U.N. inspectors, said he wouldn't be surprised if Hussein tried to use them.

But he also said, ``He may destroy them to embarrass us,'' to show the world he never had such weapons and that Bush invaded for no reason other than aggression.	
The U.S. forces zeroing in on Baghdad _ the 1st Marine Division from the east and the Army's 3rd Mechanized Infantry Division _ are trained in urban warfare.

But in such close-quarters fighting, they would lose much of the technological advantage of their air supremacy, which would have to be curtailed because bombing in a city can cause large civilian casualties.	city PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-58" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC"

``Our forces would be capable of dealing with it reasonably.	
But there would be lots of casualties on all sides,'' Korb said.

In the assessment, which they have shared with Japan , South Korea and other allies in recent weeks, officials at the Central Intelligence Agency said that U.S. satellites have identified a sophisticated new nuclear testing site in an area called Youngdoktong .	site PLACE country="KP" form="NOM" id="Pl-498" type="FAC",Youngdoktong PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" id="Pl-35" type="RGN",area PLACE country="KP" form="NOM" id="Pl-504" type="FAC",U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-23" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY",Japan PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-31" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY",South Korea PLACE country="KR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19283410" id="Pl-34" latLong="37.000°N 127.500°E" type="COUNTRY"

According to officials who have been briefed on the U.S. reports, conventional explosions simulating a nuclear detonation have been set off at the testing site , which is near North Korea 's main nuclear complex .

Now, administration officials say they fear that the country is on the verge of producing five or six new weapons, some of which might be miniaturized.	country PLACE country="KP" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-27" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
``This would give them the range they never had before, and the chance to spread their threat far beyond South Korea ,'' said one senior Asian official, noting that approximately 60,000 U.S. troops are based in Japan . ``It changes the dynamics of the problem.'' The new intelligence estimates provided to Asian allies, however, left it unclear how quickly the North could produce the small warheads.	range PLACE country="KP" form="NOM" id="Pl-497" type="FAC",U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-23" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY",North PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-45" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY",Japan PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-31" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY",South Korea PLACE country="KR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19283410" id="Pl-34" latLong="37.000°N 127.500°E" type="COUNTRY"
The worst-case estimate, officials say, is that they could do so in less than a year.	
(STORY CAN END HERE.	
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) U.S. satellites have been watching North Korean nuclear activity intently since late last year, when the North evicted international inspectors.

Those inspectors had stood guard over a collection of 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods, which can be reprocessed into weapons-grade plutonium.	
In January the country began to re-start its nuclear rexrOgessing equipment, which had been mothballed for nearly a decade under a 1994 agreement with the Clinton administration.	country PLACE country="KP" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-27" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
But according to U.S. officials, it now appears that North Korean engineers ran into technical problems in restarting the facilities.	North Korea PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-11" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY",U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-23" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY",North Korean PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-8" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY",North PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-45" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
While intelligence officials have reached no consensus, they told allies last week that in the worst case, only a few hundred of the 8,000 rods had been converted into plutonium.	
It would take 1,000 to 1,500 rods to make enough plutonium for a weapon, experts say.	
O ``What we are told is that it would take perhaps six months after that to produce a miniaturized warhead, and put it into one of the missiles,'' said one senior official who has recently reviewed the intelligence.	
``But after Iraq , who knows how good those estimates are?'' After the claims made about prohibited weapons in Iraq , which have not been found so far, skepticism about the quality of U.S. intelligence is widespread.	Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-40" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY",U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-23" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
And in the case of North Korea , as in Iraq , the immediacy of the threat depends on whose analysis seems most compelling.	North Korea PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-11" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY",Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-40" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY",North PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-45" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
So far, U.S. intelligence has picked up almost no sign of the telltale krypton gas that is released into the atmosphere when nuclear fuel rods are converted into weapons-grade plutonium.	U.S. PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-23" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
This has led some analysts to argue that the North Koreans may be farther from producing a weapon than feared a few months ago.

But others note that trucks were seen carrying the rods out of their normal storage area months ago, and it is unclear where they are _ or even whether the United States is sniffing for the krypton gas in the right place.	United States PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-46" type="COUNTRY",area PLACE country="KP" form="NOM" id="Pl-504" type="FAC"
``We don't believe that the main reprocessing facility has been very active,'' said one senior administration official in a recent interview.	facility PLACE country="KP" form="NOM" id="Pl-505" type="FAC"
``But could there be a second reprocessor?	
No one knows for sure.'' Without question, though, North Korea 's capabilities greatly outstrip anything Iraq has had in the past decade, and North Korea 's program is probably several years ahead of Iran 's.

 E-MAILS SHOW ANALYST PRIVATELY CRITICIZED HEALTHSOUTH	
congressional committee released a second e-mail message on Thursday by the Wall Street analyst who criticized the company just months after giving its stock the highest possible rating.	Wall Street PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-1" state="NY" type="ROAD"
The analyst, Howard G. Capek, resigned under pressure last week when UBS executives discovered the first e-mail message.	
In the e-mail message released on Thursday, written in August 1999, Capek responded to a query asking him why HealthSouth's stock was ``acting like such a pig again.'' In his reply, he promised to send ``a few charts and graphs which should glaringly highlight the company's inability to collect and convert sales into cash and also their inability to reinvest cash at good rates of return $2:427y|?BG been accused of orchestrating a sweeping accounting fraud, and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce is investigating the company, the nation 's largest chain of rehabilitation hospitals.	nation PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" type="COUNTRY"
The committee is also looking into UBS' investment banking relationship with HealthSouth, and Capek an&amp; two UBS investment bankers are expected to testify in September.	
Members of the House committee also sent a letter to Capek in which they told him that ``these e-mails raise questions about the extent to which you truly believed that HealthSouth was a `strong buy,''' and requested information about his correspondence on HealthSouth and related companies.	
``Certainly Mr. Capek has a lot of questions to answer,'' said Ken Johnson, a spokesman for the committee, who said it was unclear why the analyst was so bullish on the stock.	
Thomas Fitzpatrick, Capek's lawyer, again emphasized that the e-mail messages did not accurately represent Capek's views on HealthSouth.	
``We welcome the opportunity to put these two e-mails in perspective,'' Fitzpatrick said, ``and demonstrate from numerous other e-mails that his private views on HealthSouth were totally consistent with hi;:164942292920914$29042:42:;72604662990329;292:42776 7729of this nature.	
In the first message released, written in September 1999, Capek told an investor that ``he would not own a share'' in HealthSouth.	
``We need to speak on this,'' he said.	
Capek had been viewed as extremely bullish on the company and was one of the last analysts to downgrade the stock from a buy rating when the shares plummeted in March.	
The potential conflicts facing research analysts has received substantial attention from regulators, and Henry Blodget, a former analyst at Merrill Lynch, was recently barred from the securities industry for his private criticism of stocks that he supported in public.	
Capek was forced to resign from UBS because he had discussed the stock with a client at a time when HealthSouth and UBS were involved in an investment banking deal that barred him from expressing any view on the stock, UBS executives have said.	
``We continue to cooperate with regulators,'' a UBS spokesman said, ``and we assume Howard Capek will cooperate as well.'' The committee also released minutes of a HealthSouth board meeting in June 1999 that Capek had attended with William C. McGahan, the former deputy for UBS' top health-care banker who has since left the firm for personal reasons.	
The two were there to discuss ``Project Mercury,'' a proposed spinoff of the company's inpatient operations, according to the minutes.	
That was the only HealthSouth board meeting Capek attended, his lawyer said, and it was while he was clearly playing the role of adviser.	
Regulators are investigating the research and investment banking departments at UBS to determine whether the bank had a role in HealthSouth's collapse.	
 WILLIAM SCHERLE, CONGRESSMAN, DEAD AT 80	
William Scherle, who represented southwest Iowa for four terms in Congress, died on Wednesday in Council Bluffs .

 Who will lead the revolution? Would you believe MBAs?	
2004-12-24T10:07:00 For my holiday post, I offer a message of hope for the business world.	
In 1994, I was a graduate student in Boston .	Boston PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:618565" id="Pl-1" latLong="42.358°N 71.060°W" state="US-MA" type="PPLA"
I was asked to moderate a panel discussion on social entrepreneurship for a conference at Harvard Business School.	
The conference was being held by a new group called Students for Responsible Business.	
I expected to see a small gathering of idealistic, slightly naive MBA students.	
What I found was a packed room of 200 intelligent, practical,driven idealists.	room PLACE country="US" id="Pl-5" state="US-MA" type="FAC"
These students were determined to figure out how to use business as a driver for positive social change.	
I left that room with my eyes open to the possibilities presented by these future business leaders.	room PLACE country="US" id="Pl-5" state="US-MA" type="FAC"
Fast forward 10 years.	
Students for Responsible Business is now called Net Impact .	
In 2004, I had the opportunity to attend their conference hosted by The University of Texas McCombs Business School.	Texas PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780801" id="Pl-2" latLong="31.250°N 99.250°W" predicative="true" state="US-TX" type="CIVIL"
Net Impact had grown to include over 9,000 MBA students and alumni.	
Approximately 900 people attended the 2004 conference.	
The buzz words flying around the conference included social entrepreneurship, sustainable profitability, working with passion.	
I met student after student intent on harnessing the forces of business and capitalism to improve the world.	
These students understand that business is a powerful lever of change in this world.	
Recently business schools have received their share of criticism for turning out graduates who seem to have lost sight of their responsibility for ethical action.	
I can tell you that I am seeing a powerful groundswell of change coming from within business schools.	
It is not coming from the faculty, or the alumni, or the administration.	
All these groups continue to pay lipservice to topics of social responsibility while avoiding any real innovations in the student experiences.	
The change is being demanded by the students.	
A little secret of business schools is that MBA students have an immense amount of sway.	
Few choose to use it, but if they want they can fundamentally change their school.	
Right now students at business schools are asking for more discussion of these topics in classes, are initiating service projects, forming support group for social entrepreneurs, inviting speakers to campus to discuss sustainability, social investing, non-profit innovations, etc.	
Net Impact is often at the center of these efforts.	
These are not isolated events...This is a revolution from within.	
I have no doubt that in 10 years we will see the vast positive impact that these students are having in the world of business and society at large.	
In 1776 Adam Smith spoke of enlightened self-interest in The Wealth of Nations .	
I often feel that we have conveniently forgotten his emphasis on enlightened which he defined as being committed to being a good citizen and steward of society.	
I am excited and hopeful that this new generation of business leaders will bring this emphasis front and center.	
If you are an MBA student and want a good reference for comparing how MBA programs integrate issues of sustainability and social responsibility into the student experience a good place to start is the Beyond Grey Pinstripes report produced by The Aspen Institute .	
Happy Holidays to everyone!!	
 It's Good to be the King!	
2005-01-03T09:44:00 Here's an entertaining little morsel from Business Week Online (no byline given): But on the subject of succession, those two look like role models compared with insurance giant American International Group Inc. ( AIG ), whose aging CEO has no plans to retire.	
Maurice R. "Hank" Greenberg, who turns 80 in May, groomed two sons to be successors, but both have since left AIG.Greenberg Sr. then created an office of the chairman in 2002, which includes co-COOs Martin J. Sullivan and Donald P. Kanak.	
Both are considered possible successors, but the board won't know Greenberg's preference until his departure, when it opens a sealed letter.	
Perhaps this is a good time for a quick refresher.	
... refresher..	
.. refresher...	
. refresher....	
The CEO works for the board ...end lesson.	
I guess it is not as straight forward when your CEO is also chairman and one of the largest shareholders.	
It would be tempting to get on my high horse right now about the need to separate the positions of CEO and Chairman but to be honest with you I don't really believe that.	
I know CEO chair duality is a popular cause for corporate governance.	
However there is little empirical evidence to suggest that separating these roles affects firm performance in either a positive or negative way.	
Having a combined CEO Chairman does reduce the ability of the board to act as a check on management and this does mean that you need to be more critical in your assessment of the trustworthiness of the top management team.	
This downside of having a combined CEO chair is offset by (1) a reduction of coordination and communication costs at the top of the organization and (2) an increase in the negotiating position of the CEO when dealing with suppliers, potential merger partners, etc. #2 could be particularly useful in a dynamic industry.	
I do however look more carefully at the top management team of a company with a CEO Chair before investing.	
It is important that you can get a sense of the trustworthiness of the CEO.	
Is there high turnover among senior managers?	
Is there a record of regulatory problems?	
If the CEO is new, I also look at the performance of the CEO's previous company.	
I am most concerned if the fortunes of the prior employer took a sudden turn for the worse after the CEO left.	
 How to find securities class action lawsuits	
2005-01-05T09:22:00 Yesterday's bad day for Krispy Kreme included some speculation that the new securities lawsuit filed against the company would be granted class action status.	
If you are interested in getting information about securities class actions for a company, you should check out the Stanford Law School's Securities Class Action Clearinghouse .	Stanford PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1868061" id="Pl-1" latLong="37.424°N 122.165°W" predicative="true" state="US-CA" type="PPL"
This site has a very easy to use search function and it might be worth the time to run a quick check on companies of interest to you as possible investments.	
Researchers affiliated with the clearinghouse just released an interesting report about securities class action trends during 2004.	
The results highlight trends in types of filings (increase in product market related filings), affected sectors (big increase in energy &amp; technology sector), and overall number of filings (fairly steady).

 Shareholders Benefit from Employer Reputation	
2005-01-08T13:23:00 It is just about time for Fortune magazine to release its 2005 list of 100 Best Companies to Work For .	
So now is a good time to ask a simple question: Why should we care?	
Making this list is certainly a source of pride.	
It can also be helpful if you are looking for a nice new job.	
Should anyone else pay attention to this list?	
Well, thanks for asking because I just happen to have an answer for that question.	
It turns out that investors can benefit by paying attention to this list as well.	
In a study published in the Journal of Business Finance &amp; Accounting (2003, 30:771-798), Greg Filbeck and Dianna Preece found that companies on the Fortune list of 100 Best Companies to Work For outperformed a matched sample of firms along multiple measures of return.	
This study is particularly relevant for investors because the authors measured return after the list was announced.	
To often these studies use as a starting point the moment before information becomes public.	
The only way to benefit from such information is by holding the stock before the information becomes public.	
This study indicates that the Best Companies to Work For information may still be useful even after the information becomes public.	
It might also be useful to look at companies that have consistently made the list in the previous few years and make an educated guess about their inclusion on this year's list.	
Search the news archives and see if in the past year the company did anything that might have totally pissed off their employees.	
Massive layoffs, bitter union battles, stopped offering free massages, etc.	
You might also want to be wary if the CEO or a bunch of other top executives have been replaced.	
That can often generate a period of uncertainty in a workforce.	
 It's hard to complain about cheap airfares but..	
2005-01-09T19:47:00 I can't for the life of me figure out why anyone would invest in the airline industry.	
Please, someone tell me a group companies facing more serious problems than the legacy airline carriers (Delta, US Airways, Continental, American , Northwestern, United).

High fuel costs, insane pension obligations, and a highly paid, specialized workforce.	
To this list of woes, we add a whole slew of competitors with much lower cost structures.	
I admit I've already taken advantage of the lower fares announced last week to book a business trip but these next few years are not going to be pretty for some of these companies.	
Unfortunately, the pain is not limited to these companies.

 Better Late Than Ne...Aww forget it!	
2005-01-10T10:09:00 Remember how you stress every year to get those #%^^$%# tax forms filed on time?	
Just imagine how Nortel feels.	
Early on Tuesday Nortel will be filing its 2003 financial statements .	
It also expects to restate 2001 and 2002 earnings.	
None of this is really new information.	
So the worst is behind them right?	
Maybe.	
Late filing of audited financial statements and earning restatements both factor into my External Reporting organizational indicator.	
As a rule, I am wary of companies that do either of these things until I am confident that they have changed their standard business practices.	
It may take a couple years, and several more financial filings (on time of course), before I am persuaded to take a second look at the company.	
The bottom line is that I rely on SEC filings to assess companies and I don't want to have any doubt about the veracity of the information contained in these documents.	
In Nortel's defense, they have just gone through the perfect storm in the telecommunications equipment sector.	
The whole industry overbuilt and got blindsided by the tech downturn.	
This could be described as a growth industry that went on a bender and is now trying to recover from the hangover.	
I've always felt that you learn a lot about someone when you see how they try to recover from a hangover (pause for brief college flashback).	
This is a great time to assess organizational effectiveness in the telecommunications equipment industry.	
Nortel and Lucent attempted to hide the damage (What do you mean?	
I'm not drunk!) and hope for an uptick in demand before they would have to come clean.	
Both companies have been penalized for these actions and have continued to restructure operations, sell assets, and layoff employees.	
Cisco, on the other hand, was able to take one huge restructuring charge in 2001 and move forward.	
Their ability to do this and have it work (so far) indicates a very deep and impressive understanding of their organization.	
Especially when compared to its competitors, Cisco seems to be back in fighting form due to it's ability to rapidly assess its organizational structure and reconfigure to meet the changing market.	
Not bad for a company with a hangover!

2005-02-03T21:02:00 Socially responsible investing.	
Corporate social responsibility.	
Just saying these words seems to elicit some fairly simplistic knee-jerk reactions.	
The reaction that I find most amusing is the knowing look of sympathy.	
You know, the one that says "Poor naive soul.	
If only you understood economics, you would understand the folly of your ways."	
I do not intend to get into the stakeholder vs stockholder debate here or argue the relative merits of Atlas Shrugged .	
Those discussions, though interesting, avoid a simpler question.	
Do measures of corporate social responsibility contain valuable added information that help investors pick winning investments?	
If all that you have read about this topic is an article in Business Week or The Wall Street Journal , you've probably heard the standard answer-- the evidence is mixed.	Wall Street PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-1" predicative="true" state="US-NY" type="ROAD"
That is true but not very revealing wouldn't you say?	
Evidence is mixed mostly because (1) there is little agreement about how to measure social responsibility and (2) many current measures toss together a heap of information that has no business being lumped together.	
Social responsibility often includes everything from treatment of employees to type of product produced.	
There is not really any reason to believe that selling guns or tobacco has anything to do with forcing employees to work unpaid overtime.	
Yet both get lumped together in the socially responsible investing discussion.	
Once you start to break apart social responsibility into its various components, you start to see the valuable information.	
Companies that have poor employee relations tend to underperform, as do companies that pollute at a higher rate than their industry peers.	
On the other hand, companies with numerous NLRB violations don't do worse than their peers and companies that sell your typical "sin" products (tobacco, firearms, gambling) can be excellent investments.	
Lump all these things together and of course you will get mixed results.	
Taken separately, they provide valuable information about future firm performance.	
I guess it is time to get beyond the image of the greedy capitalist vs. hippie tree hugger in this discussion.	
Though that would make a great Celebrity Death Match episode.	
Here are abstracts from 16 significant studies about socially responsible investing and an interesting essay on the subject.	
 I'll take a double shot

As far as I could tell, many people in the Northwest spend the mornings drinking lattes and their evenings drinking microbrews.	Northwest PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-4" mod="NW" type="COUNTRY"
Really not a bad lifestyle.	
Anyway, back on topic here.	
Market over reaction?	
Hard to say.	
Both companies have pricey stocks and those valuations are based on optimistic expectations of future growth.	
Yesterday's news led many to question their growth assumptions for these companies.	
Today I want to talk a bit about Starbucks.	
I think I have to start by acknowledging that the stock is still pricey even after its drop yesterday.	
However, my organizational indicators analysis reveals a very low level of business risk .	
This may partially justify a higher P E ratio.	
A couple weeks ago, I observed that Wal-Mart had offsetting strong and weak organizational indicators . Starbucks, on the other hand, has uniformly strong organizational indicators.	
Starbucks scores as best in its industry on six of seven organizational indicators.	
Not surprising are its strong scores in the employee relations and stakeholder actions indicators.	
Its weakest score is in the external reporting indicator.	
In the past, several observers have raised concerns about aggressive accounting at Starbucks but my analysis does not indicate any systematic current issues.	
The weak score is primarily the result of Starbucks current strategy of increasing equity ownership of several foreign subsidiaries.	
This is a strategic shift that has short-term costs and adds some uncertainty to the financial statements.	
Beyond the strong Organizational Indicator analysis, several additional factors favor Starbucks ability to continue to grow revenues. 1. Starbucks has little debt.	
Starbucks is not currently financing its growth with debt.	
Considering its growth, this is amazing.	
It also means that Starbucks has a large amount of flexibility in how it finances future growth.	
The company can assume much more debt without negatively affecting its risk profile because..	
. 2.	
Starbucks has a healthy cashflow and current cash position.	
This allows the company to grow without debt.	
You could argue that Starbucks has too much cash and should do more to pass it on to shareholders.	
This option is another way that Starbucks has retained its flexibility for the future.	
3. Starbucks is the primary owner of its stores and limits franchising.	
While Starbucks does partner (airlines, airports, Barnes &amp; Noble), most of its stores are company owned.	
From a managerial perspective this greatly simplifies cost structures, product changes, and quality control.	
Taken together all of these factors paint a picture of a company with a very strong future.	
I cannot say if these factors justify the current share price but I would say that they justify a higher P E ratio than the industry norm.	
Risk is lower.	
Interesting aside: Starbucks is taking over the location in my town that was recently abandoned by Krispy Kreme.	location PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-21" type="FAC",town PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-22" type="FAC"
Disclosure: At the time of this writing I do not own Starbucks stock...but I am tempted and might consider a buy next week.	
I am also tempted to go buy a latte after writing this post.	
 Boeing: The costs of lapses in ethical judgment	
2005-03-07T08:50:00 Boeing has managed to become a perfect case study in how corporate ethics codes frequently do not translate into action.	
Last week, I wrote about research that asks when do ethics codes influence executive action .	
Boeing illustrates the costs (to person and company) of ignoring corporate codes of conduct.	
First the juicy news : Costs to person Boeing Forces CEO Harry Stonecipher to Resign Over Relationship With Female Executive from AP via Yahoo!	
Boeing said an internal investigation prompted by information sent anonymously to Chairman Lew Platt and the company's legal and ethics leaders 10 days ago revealed a "consensual" relationship between Stonecipher and the female executive that the board determined was in violation of the company's code of conduct.	
The key here is that Stonecipher's actions violated the code of conduct.	
This might be a grey area if Boeing did not have rules governing this type of activity..but it does.	
As Chairman Lew Platt says, "The Board concluded that the facts reflected poorly on Harry's judgment and would impair his ability to lead the company."	
It is not the relationship, per se, but initiating it in violation of a stated code of conduct that is a troubling action by a CEO.	
Next up: Costs to company Today, the Wall Street Journal reports on details of the Air Force's decision to allow Boeing to bid again on rocket contracts.	Wall Street PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-2" state="NY" type="ROAD"
You may recall that Boeing was banned from such contracts for significant ethical lapses in previous contract bidding.	
Specifically, Boeing illegally procured and used information from rival bidder Lockheed Martin.	
The Air Force is imposing an unprecedented and costly set of ethics program oversight rules.	
While some may feel that the rules unfairly meddle in Boeing's internal affairs, I think it is useful to remember that Boeing brought them on through their own actions.	
Boeing betrayed the trust of one of its primary customers.	
Once trust is betrayed it is hard to get it back.	
Lack of trust is one of the primary reasons we increase transaction costs by negotiating written contracts with multiple stipulations (think pre-nuptual agreements here).	
From the Wall Street Journal article: "The extent of some of the controls, according to government officials, partly reflects Boeing's failure to comply with an earlier administrative agreement with the Air Force."	Wall Street PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-2" state="NY" type="ROAD"
Boeing continues to be a bit of an ethical sinkhole.	
Hopefully, these recent actions signal a bottoming out and Boeing can begin to reclaim some of its former glory as a symbol of business success.	
Unfortunately, losing trust is much easier than rebuilding trust.	
 ChevronTexaco Unocal news	
2005-04-04T16:06:00 From AP (via Yahoo): ChevronTexaco to Buy Unocal in $16.	
4B Deal I just have some quick thoughts about this buyout.	
I generally steer clear of companies involved in mergers.	
Merging companies is a complex process that is fraught with landmines.	
On top of this, the purchasing company has numerous incentives to 1. overbid and 2. overestimate cost savings to justify the overbidding.	
However, this move by ChevronTexaco seems to fit that subset of mergers that can avoid the standard landmines. 1. ChevronTexaco has some great experience to build off of with its merger with Texaco.	
Matthew Hayward studied 214 acquisitions by 120 firms between 1990 and 1995 ( 2002 Strategic Management Journal, Vol 23:1 ).	
He found that acquisition performance is positively related to previous experience with acquisitions that are 1. not too similar or dissimilar with the current acquisition, 2. associated with small losses, and 3. not too temporally close or distant from the current acquisition.	
The Texaco merger does not align along all of these dimensions but the key is that it is temporally close enough that the institutional knowledge about what does and does not work with a major merger should still be fresh.	
It is also temporally far enough removed from the present that the company will not be overwhelmed with internal change.	
2. The oil and gas industry is driven by future projections about supply and this merger is all about Unocal's natural gas and oil properties.	
Provided ChevronTexaco did not overpay for these assets (an issue I will leave to those more knowledgable about this industry), the addition of these increasingly valuable assets should more than makeup for the inevitable over-optimistic estimates of cost savings from merging operations.	
Previously, I 've made the point that my approach can be viewed as a "spidey sense" add on to fundamental company analysis.	
Recall that Spiderman's spidey sense is the ultimate pessimist's super power.	
It warns of impending danger, not impending good fortune.	
Many of the variables that I examine seem to work best as red flags that warn of potential danger hidden within a company.	
Well, I guess I can say that my spidey sense is not tingling with this merger as it usually does with large corporate mergers.	
 Can I get Security Clearence? Or I am done forever.	
Sat, 19 Mar 2005 20:31:04 -0500 Can I get Security Clearence?	 
Or I am done forever.	 
Hi: I am in a dilemma.	 
I am a experienced Oracle DBA Unix Sys Adm and a Com Sci grad. from Carleton and have been out of work for about 6 months now.	 
I have a chance of getting a position but it requires enhanced security clearence.	 
Now, back in my high school days I was charged and convicted for assault (after I had just turned 18) for punching some bully.	 
And at that time I did'tn know what "conditional sentence" was as my lawyer provided by the court to me told me that if I pleaed guilty that's what I would get and "all this will end".	 
Additonally, he told me that I would'nt have a record (as this charge would disappear after 3 years).	 
This happened in 1998, and recently when I was asked to get a police report check for one of jobs I had applied for, I was told that I had a record.	 
So basically, now after 7 years I have located thsi bad news and possibly would ruin my chances of getting any decent job.	 
My question is (who may shed some light on this), can you pass Enhance Reliability Clearence in my position?	 
From my research it shows that I would have to apply for pardon with govt.	 
Or I can get my case reopened and see what my options are (as I was never guilty but I did what I did in self defense).	 
Can anyone advise me on this? (of course I plan to speak to a legal professional as well but looking for someone who may know if its possible to get security clearance in my situation).	 
Appreciate your time.	 
Thank you.	 
Trev B Sat, 19 Mar 2005 21:32:21 -0500 Re: Can I get Security Clearence?	 
Or I am done forever.	 
I'm no lawyer, but I think your only option would be to apply for a pardon.	 
The courts would not re-open your case as you had pleaded guilty to the charge, whether it was warranted or not.	 
May be different had you been found guilty and new evidence appeared to support your claim of innocence.	 
You're best to seek the advice of a lawyer, not others in this forum.	 
I think the The Law Society of Upper Canada provides a free 30 minute consultation with a barrister, though that may have changed.	 
I can tell you that a lawyer is not needed to apply for a pardon.

A non property offense with limited possibility of personal gain helps.	 
The fact that the sentence was so recent does not. 50 50 at best but worth a shot.

Or I am done forever.	 
I would say Joe has the best view of this situation.	 
I am an ACSO (Alternate Corporate Security Officer, big title, means I push more paper for the same pay!) and I am the go-to person for Federal Clearances.	 
I'll likely be able to get you a clearance but I will take some time(3-6 months is my guess). you will need a transcript of your conviction (opp-RCMP) and likely need fingerprints.	 
Reliability shoud be no problem but Secret is pretty much out of the question (not impossible just highly improbable) until your pardon.	 
Feel free to contact me.

I've browsed around the internet and can't find the information I'm after.	
What's the deal with parole?	
If you get out on parole, what happens then, and how long does it last? (and, specifically, who takes you home once you get out of jail, or do you just get turfed out and expected to check in with your parole officer the next day?	
). day?).	
And, again fairly specifically (and I realise this is state specific, but I'm kinda looking for a general answer here): if an eighteen year old gets caught selling marijuana to 12-14 year olds, and gets put away for, say, three years, is this the sort of deal where he's likely to get parole, or just do the time and leave again?	
-Mark Erikson Vinny R. Tue, 08 Feb 2005 14:22:50 -0500 Re: [TAN] Parole Getting out on parole is usually a reward for good behavior while serving time.	
So you're basically free, with the expectation that you will not leave the state (assuming you've been jailed by the state gov't) and you have to check in with your parole officer on a regular basis (I think they give you a schedule).	
I *believe* you are also expected to get a job, housing, etc. and report this also.	
In some cases you may be referred to a specific 'halfway' house for reintroduction into society, and provided with a simple job.	
As for how long it lasts, I would say that it lasts for the rest of your sentence, but I'm not sure about that.	
Also, you can call someone to come pick you up when you leave, or call a taxi I guess.	
Not just state-specific, judge(jury)-specific and case-specific.	
For some reason, I can't recall if selling drugs to minors qualifies as a jury trial or what.	
But these decisions are entirely up to the judge jury, and the decision is usually made in regard to the character of the defendant.

You have to provide a planned residence when you're considered for parole, usually a relative or program of some kind.	
It lasts as long as the rest of your sentence lasts.	
You can go back to prison for violating the conditions of your parole, for a period of time up until your sentence runs out.	
Parole is not a right and its granting is discretionary.

Keep recounting the votes until you get the results you want and if you need to go "find" some more votes in a warehouse, in a box, hidden behind some other boxes.

The USCF did not even have the money to pay the guaranteed prizes at the just concluded US Open in Los Angeles . Therefore, on August 20, 2003, bravely Beatriz walked into the USCF Offices in New Windsor and immediately fired 17 staff members.	US PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY",Los Angeles PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1663328" id="Pl-2" latLong="34.052°N 118.243°W" state="US-CA" type="PPL"
John McCrary resigned from the board as a result.	
Of course, it was just a pure coincidence that the 17 people Beatriz fired were the people she had grown to dislike during the year that she worked for the USCF in 1999-2000.	US PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
It took six weeks before the USCF paid the guaranteed prizes the prize winners had won at the US Open.	US PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
I have just found out something that insiders had known for a long time.	
The USCF did not have zero money in the bank.	US PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
It had $85,000 in another bank account that nobody knew about.	
This was not due to any malfeasance.	
The office accountant for the USCF had set up a separate bank account and had put the entry fees from the US Open into that account.	US PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
Nobody knew about that separate bank account, except for the accountant herself.	
When this was discovered, the accountant explained that she was planning to keep the money in that account until the tournament was closed out.	
Perhaps the accountant was following a procedure followed by the USCF for scholastic tournaments.	US PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
At scholastic tournaments, no cash prizes are paid.	
However, in adult tournaments, the players expect to receive their prizes, and to receive them immediately.	
For this act of stupidity which had caused a grave crisis in the USCF, the accountant was immediately fired.	US PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
Had the existence of this $85,000 in a secret bank account been known, it would not have been necessary to fire those 17 people right away.	
Perhaps in the long run it was a good thing to fire them, but it might not have been a good idea to fire them all abruptly, in the same day.

And I knew about it also.	
I also knew about the $100,000+ of audit adjustments (and non-adjustments) for inventory, unbilled advertising, newsstand sales, tournament revenues, pension &amp;health insurance over-accruals, multi year membership revenue, etc. etc. that I was too sick to argue with Linda and the auditors about.	
I knew that they would get corrected as a matter of course during fiscal 2004 resulting in understatement of 2003 income and overstatement of 2004.	
And, of course, that is what happened.	
I just had no idea that the new Board would see it as leverage to seize power and pummel the office staff.	
Not only was there adequate cash put aside, we had approval for an equity loan on the building to bridge the move.	
But I didn't want to pay the $10,000 points and interest unless and until it was absolutely necessary.	
We also had a buyer for the building at a prize much higher than it was eventually sold for and a commitment for 4% bank financing in Crossville .	Crossville PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1307203" id="Pl-11" latLong="35.949°N 85.027°W" state="US-TN" type="PPL"

To make the staff cuts without the system changes was absurd and probably the reason for McCrary &amp;Camaratta's departures.	
When I offered to attend the Board meeting in October 2003 to explain and clarify all this, I was told I was not welcome.	
I sat in New Windsor all weekend waiting for a phone call so I could answer EB questions and shed light on the situation.

He lost the national popular vote by at least 1,750,000.	
This shows you the scale of the fraud.	
The exit polls were not wrong.	
Kerry was the clear winner, but victory was snatched from him.	
Florida first.	Florida PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:295478" id="Pl-13" latLong="28.750°N 82.500°W" state="FL" type="CIVIL"
The 200,000+ margin of victory for Bush made this state uncontestable.	state PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:1780794" id="Pl-22" latLong="43.667°N 71.500°W" state="NH" type="CIVIL"
Everybody assumes that even with some fraud, Kerry could never have made up the difference in a recount.	
But Kerry actually won by about 750,000 votes.	
The numbers were changed by a computer program (in both electronic and scan-tron voting systems) called "KerryLite.""KerryLite" of course is not actual name of the program.	
The actual name is 11-5-18-18 etc.	
For additional encryption, the numbers were jumbled but I'm not sure in which order.	
The numbers replace the letters of the alphabet.	
For example, K is the eleventh letter of the alphabet.	
So the if-then statement goes something like this: "if total true Kerry)total true Bush, Bush x 1.04x (.04 is a random number)(total true Kerry), total true Bush".	state PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:1780794" id="Pl-22" latLong="43.667°N 71.500°W" state="NH" type="CIVIL"
The second part of the equation takes the total number of votes cast and subtracts the new Bush total, subtracts the third party totals and leaves the rest for Kerry.	
Sometimes the program would also reduce third party votes and award them to Bush.	
And even where Bush legitimately won, he was still awarded additional votes.	
The big Democratic counties (Broward for example) went to Kerry because it had to appear that everything was on the up and up.	
It's interesting to see this unfold.	
Does anybody wonder why the Republican counties were mostly counted after the Democratic counties?	
You should wonder, and also know that this was no accident.	
The Bush team had to make up the votes as the night went on.	
In Ohio , computer voting fraud, vote tossing and voter suppression were the main methods.	Ohio PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1086497" id="Pl-15" latLong="40.250°N 83.000°W" state="OH" type="CIVIL"
Vote tossing was simply the removal of Kerry votes and some third party votes.	
In some areas, the Bush vs. Kerry votes were absurd.	
Nine to one, eight to two.	
Voter suppression took the form of making voters stand in four hour long lines.	
This of course took place in Democratic areas.	
The simplest thing to do was to have too few voting machines.	
Sometimes that's all it takes.	
People eventually lose patience and leave without casting a vote.	
In other states such as New Mexico , Nevada , Iowa and New Hampshire , Kerry's leads evaporated very quickly once the polls were shut down.	New Hampshire PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780794" id="Pl-20" latLong="43.667°N 71.500°W" state="NH" type="CIVIL",state PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:1780794" id="Pl-22" latLong="43.667°N 71.500°W" state="NH" type="CIVIL",New Mexico PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:898535" id="Pl-16" latLong="34.500°N 106.000°W" state="NM" type="CIVIL",Iowa PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780785" id="Pl-18" latLong="42.000°N 93.500°W" state="IA" type="CIVIL",Nevada PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780793" id="Pl-17" latLong="39.250°N 116.750°W" state="NV" type="CIVIL"

Nothing this massive can be kept a secret.

Even people who mindlessly defend Bush's policies, like wjb67, don't want to take responsibility for Talent -- they point out that he was originally appointed by Clinton.	
Franks was in charge of the operation that was supposed to quickly go in, take over Iraq , and then start moving our troops out rapidly -- at this point I think we're going to see our troops over there at least through the end of the decade.

This is just one more of those wierd, through-the-looking-glass moments when Bush is trying to make something that at the very least has to be seen as troubling, and that I consider an unmitigated failure, into a success. rpmoria...@aol.com 15 Dec 2004 13:01:46 -0800 Re: Bush has no shame (NPC) Troubling indeed....I will say go a little easier on Franks-not that he deserves a medal- than the other two idiots though.	
He was not given very much to work with--Cheney and Rummy are the ones to blame for the screwed up war plans-of course I am sure they will get their medals too.	
Bush is one of those guys that just sees how he wants to see, and that is a terrible trait for a leader to have---rose-colored something something I beleive it's called.

this is a cop-out response. the reason we are so worried is because we are on a higher level than 90% of the world because we have nucler weapons.	
if countries we don't like start developing nuclear weapons-grade material it makes us nervous.	
although so far, iran has shown that they are *not* producing weapons-grade material and are in fact using their nuclear power for just that, according to the IAEA. but when you have a sitting president who has an infatuation with provoking other countries into a war, you can bet that he will try everything he can to try to prove his case against iran . maybe because oil is a much bigger polluting source of energy than nuclear? or maybe because it's more cost effective for them to use nuclear than any other method? why should they run their energy supply off of one of their backbone industries when oil is worth more to them on the open market?	iran PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16932748" id="Pl-22" latLong="32.000°N 53.000°E" type="COUNTRY"

 There is one Carousel organization again	
17 Feb 2005 17:19:51 -0800 There is one Carousel organization again I just received the latest issue of Merry-Go-Roundup, the quarterly publication of the National Carousel Association .	
In it was a blurb reporting that the American Carousel Society had recently disbanded.	American PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
Some of you may be wondering why there were two carousel organizations in the first place.	
The National Carousel Association was founded in the early 1970's by a group of art historians and collectors, including Frederick Fried, author of the 1964 book "A Pictorial History of The Carousel" that single-handedly gave the classic hand-carved wooden carousel the respect and appreciation it deserved.	
Other founders included Charlotte Dinger, who was already a major collector of carousel artwork at the time.	
The purpose of the NCA is "to promote conservation, appreciation, knowledge and enjoyment of the art of the classic wooden carousel and especially the preservation of complete wooden carousels."	
The organization attracted a wide range of members, including carousel enthusiasts, owners operators, theme and amusement parks, museums, libraries, those in the entertainment recreation industry, art collectors and even auction houses, among others.	
It was the presence of these last two named groups that would eventually stir up controversy.	
Thanks in large part to the NCA, the art of the carousel was receiving a lot of public attention and appreciation that it had not enjoyed before.	
However, this new and brighter spotlight on these antique rides also had the unfortunate effect of enhancing the collectibility and monetary value of operational carousels.	
They had become worth more money dead (i.e. in pieces) than alive (i.e. functioning).	
As such, during the 1980's many beautiful and unique wooden carousels would be broken up at the auction block, as owners rushed to cash in on the antique marketplace.	
The liability insurance crisis further aggravated the situation, as amusement park operators sought to cut their losses, while at the same time liquidate underperforming carousels to raise capital for the purchase of newer and more profitable (thrill) rides.	
Some collectors of carousel art and auction houses were accused of using their NCA affiliation to gain information about vintage carousels that they could target for breakup to their own personal profit, a practice certainly contrary to the stated goals of the organization.	
The increasing rift between the "preservationists" and "collectors" would eventually boil over into an internal political struggle that caused many in the collectors faction of the NCA to walk out of the group, including founders such as Charlotte Dinger and others.	
The preservationists would chose to remain with the NCA, including Fred Fried.	
At this time in the late 1970's, carousel artwork collector and printer Marge Swenson was the editor of the NCA's Merry-Go-Roundup publication.	
The political struggle that occurred within the NCA resulted in two slates of officers being presented for approval to the membership, something that was not supposed to happen.	
A thicker-than-usual issue of the Roundup would be filled with accusations from both factions in the group each accusing the other of improper behavior.	
Swenson herself would also leave the NCA.	
Not much later, she began publishing her own magazine called "Carousel Art", which was essentially a scholarly photo album depicting different carvers and styles each month.	
Meanwhile, those collectors who left the National Carousel Association banded together to form the American Carousel Society (ACS), whose stated aims of carousel preservation also recognized collectors as a positive asset towards that goal.	American PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
For the next couple of decades, the two carousel organizations would co-exist, each attracting its share of members.	
Some would actually join both groups, and even attend both of their annual conventions.	
During the mid-1980's Walter Louck would begin publishing "The Carousel Trader", later renamed "The Carousel News &amp; Trader".	
This monthly magazine would cover all angles and sides of the story of the carousel and be well received by all carousel enthusiasts.	
About a decade later, Carousel Art would suddenly cease publication.	
The NCA would continue to issue the Roundup to its members.	
The mid to late 1990's saw the passing of NCA founder Fred Fried, and also that of Charlotte Dinger, both who represented the two opposite points of view in the carousel preservation debate.	
Coincidentally and amazingly, the art of building hand-carved carousels (and even bandorgans) has been revived, with firms such as Carousel Works and Carousel Magic again building the popular rides in classic design.	
This development seems to have greatly alleviated the antique marketplace pressures that have doomed so many legacy wooden carousels over the past several decades.	
The turn of the new millenium actually witnessesed a thaw in the relationship between the National Carousel Association and American Carousel Society, as newer and younger leadership took over from the founding generation.	American PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
The two groups decided that the bickering between them was wasteful, conterproductive and pointless.	
There was talk of a (re)merger but the regulations governing non-profits prevented that.	
However, it was decided that NCA and ACS hold joint conventions to save on costs to both the clubs and the members.	
Just within the past couple of months though, the American Carousel Society had determined that they did not have the funding to continue with the operation of their organization and officially ceased to exist.	American PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
So now, once again there is a single nationwide organization to join if you love carousels!

 Club Sports policies at schools; specifically travel restrictions	
9 Feb 2005 19:02:57 -0800 Club Sports policies at schools; specifically travel restrictions Hello everyone - I am attempting to learn more information about the policies of various athletic departments at schools, specifically with regards to ultimate teams.	
At Northwestern, the Men's Ultimate team falls under the Club Sports department which falls into a dark, barely lit corner of the Athletic Department.	
There are some restrictions on what we can and cannot do.	
The one that I am most interested in comparing to similar policies at other schools concerns our ability to travel.	
At Northwestern, we are allowed to either rent school vans for no charge or take our own vehicles to tournaments within 300 miles of Evanston , IL .	IL PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780784" id="Pl-1" latLong="40.000°N 89.250°W" state="IL" type="CIVIL",Evanston PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:409101" id="Pl-2" latLong="42.041°N 87.690°W" state="IL" type="PPL"
Also, we are allowed to fly, take a bus, or take Amtrak to any tournament we want, no matter how far away it is.	
We are allowed to compete under the Northwestern name if we take any of these options.	
However, it often occurs that we want to go to a tournament farther than 300 miles without flying.	
(For example, Regionals is often slightly farther than 300 miles, yet a reasonable drive.	
) If we choose to do so, it is understood that we are not officially competing under the Northwestern name - we are just a group of people playing ultimate at a tournament and not involving the university in any way.	
Do any of you other college players face similar restrictions in your travel?	
What are your schools' policies?	
I am interested in both the responses of players at public and private schools.	
Feel free to email me if you do want to post to the forum.	
Thanks for your help.	
Cesa Northwestern d-c...@northwestern.edu SeanMcC...@gmail.com 9 Feb 2005 19:20:39 -0800 Re: Club Sports policies at schools; specifically travel restrictions Man...you guys have it so sweet.	
Pitt gets $2000 year towards competition.	
That means bids, hotel, transportation, jerseys (I do have to mention, our jerseys this year are hot).	
That doesnt go very far, and thats a hard cap on anything related to competition for all competetive club sports teams.	
Next year we will be budgeting our jerseys as "practice jerseys" however, so we hope they'll be paid for.	
The point is, $2k gets us to about a tournament and a half using University transportation.	
I dont know about playing officially under the university's name, or why that matters really.	
As long as the registrar signs off on the roster for the UPA, doesnt the importance of University affiliation become moot?	
d-c...@northwestern.edu 9 Feb 2005 19:35:51 -0800 Re: Club Sports policies at schools; specifically travel restrictions I should clarify that NU does not specifically pay for us to fly - we get a budget as well.	
We pay for our flights rental cars out of pocket.

Our school doesn't really care what we do at tournaments or how far away we are.	
We take our own cars to every tournament, even ones down in Maryland .	Maryland PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1715934" id="Pl-5" latLong="39.000°N 76.750°W" state="MD" type="CIVIL"
The money we get from our student association has to pay for jerseys, is supposed to help us with tournaments, etc.	
Every tournament our team goes to, we each pay 10-20 bucks out of pocket.	
If you are an ultimate frisbee team and sleeping in hotels... consider yourself as spoiled as an ultimate team gets in my opinion.	
You gotta learn how to save money.	
Most tournaments will house you if you ask and explain your situation.	
If we can't get housing, we camp out somewhere.	
At Binghamton this year we threw up a tent on the high jump mat (which I must say is very comfortable).	Binghamton PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:944985" id="Pl-6" latLong="42.099°N 75.918°W" state="NY" type="PPL"

For you northwestern guys, you really need to get in touch with someone at your school that will listen.	
Our school didn't like us for a long time, but we behaved ourselves, and very respectfully approached various people, working our way up the ladder, about changing some policies.	
Start off low, and work your way up.	
Explain to them that if you are driving your own cars, you should be able to go wherever you want, and even throw in there if for any reason you bring shame to the university, you will go right back to the old policy no questions asked.	
How often do you go to a tournament and whatever happens there gets back to administration?	
pretty much never so your safe with that offer.	
Another thing we did was have a lot of fundraisers on campus, entered banner contests for sporting events, etc.	
Once the school saw that unlike a lot of clubs, we were busting our asses to fundraise and get involved with school activities, their whole attitude towards us changed.	
Sell discs, sell pint glasses, then go to someone, more than one person, and show them what kind of effort you are putting in.	
A lot of school officials don't understand how structured ultimate actually is.	
Go in and explain to them about Regionals not just being some little "get together" but actually be a championship series.

 Renewal of marriage vows on carnival cruise	
16 Feb 2005 13:36:29 -0800 Renewal of marriage vows on carnival cruise Has anybody out there seen this done?	
I saw somewhere on their site there is a lot of prep time needed to get married onboard.	
I wonder if its easier just renewing your vows as my wife has been looking for this for a while. going out on the Sensation in March for our 18th anniverary.	
Howie Wed, 16 Feb 2005 19:22:33 -0500 Re: Renewal of marriage vows on carnival cruise My wife and I were guests at a wedding on the Carnival Legend on New Years Eve 2003.	
All the guests were folks who had met the bride and groom (an attractive young couple who were sailing alone) virtually on cruisecritic.	
The wedding took place in the afternoon, before the ship set sail.	
Thus, the couple was actual married by a justice of the peace in the state of Florida .	Florida PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:295478" id="Pl-1" latLong="28.750°N 82.500°W" state="FL" type="CIVIL"
It was a great way to begin a cruise.	
Although I am not certain of this, I assume that renewing your vows could actually be done while the ship was at sea, because it would not involve any legal issues.	
Howie Len C. Wed, 16 Feb 2005 22:48:03 -0500 Re: Renewal of marriage vows on carnival cruise -Has anybody out there seen this done?	
I don't know the details, but on my last cruise there was a LARGE wedding going on.	
The bride was all decked out in her long gown and veil, groom in tux and the other wedding party all dressed to the nines!	
They had one of the larger lounges closed off for a private reception.	
I didn't think it was allowed any more, but 30 minutes until sailing an announcement was made that all NON CRUISE guests must make their way to disembark the ship prior to sailing.	
I had never heard that announcement before so I assumed that it was for the people attending the wedding on board?	
This was the largest wedding gathering I have ever seen on board... maybe someone had connections?	
?? connections??	
? connections???	
The bride was still visible later into the evening still wearing her wedding gown on the Lido Deck! Len... durango_.

These usally take a little time to set up -if you are going in March I am not sure if what would be available to you.	
They were just starting a new Renewal of Vows program, which included all we rec'd, but was cheaper.	
Since we had already paid for our package we kept it.	
Had a very nice ceremony with a justice of the peace and a small reception for the family members traveling with us.

 Carnival Corp - Shareholder Discount on Princess	
Tue, 22 Feb 2005 08:13:13 GMT Carnival Corp - Shareholder Discount on Princess I'm taking a 7 day cruise with Princess in March and applied for my $100 Carnival Corp.	
Shareholder onboard credit.	
Turns out that my travel Agent has a 'group' cruise on this ship and my $50 pp credit due to the 'group' cruise makes me ineligible for the shareholder credit.	
This really makes a mockery of the Shareholder credit as almost every cruise has some sort of small credit attached.	
$100 won't break the bank or make the cruise less enjoyable, nor will I stop being a shareholder, but I do find this sort of thing irritating.	
Stephen George Leppla Tue, 22 Feb 2005 08:04:07 -0500 Re: Carnival Corp - Shareholder Discount on Princess This is incorrect.	
Have your TA get in touch with Rebecca Faroy at Carnival Corp's Investor's Relations department.	
It seems that some Princess people aren't fully aware of the correct policy.	
The Shareholder Credit does apply to group bookings.

Until recently you could combine the stockholder credits with the credits for booking on board, but not with those from your agent.	
The most recent Carnival report under Shareholder Benefit says, "not combinable with any other shipboard offer".	
Therefore I recently sold my stock.

I believe that clause actually refers to promo cruises etc. and not to discounts, or shipboard credits offered by your TA.	
I have doubled up on shareholder credits on both Carnival Corp. cruises and RCL cruises.

Also this is a vacation, so we hope to spend some time just chilling.	
Any suggestions on changes?	
We have 3 people going, and Expedia shows the flight (round trip) and a rental car with unlimited miles being $1430, plus I'm figuring about $150 for gas and at $120 a night for hotel that's $360 total for that.	
So total cost (without food, spending cash, parking, toll roads, etc) is $1910 or about $637 each.	
I'm figuring about $850 per person should be plenty for everything -- and that's not bad for 7 nights in New Enland with all the stuff we're planning.	New Enland PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208919220" id="Pl-19" type="RGN"

We're getting a mid-sized vehicle, so if the car gets 20 mpg that's 75 gallons used.	
This times $1.90 is $145.50 or around that.

A dumb phrase, but not a dumb thought: He meant that the administration sees history as dynamic and changeable, not static and impervious to redirection or improvement.	
That is the Bush administration way, and it happens to be realistic: History is dynamic and changeable.	
On the other hand, some things are constant, such as human imperfection, injustice, misery and bad government.	
This world is not heaven.	
The president's speech seemed rather heavenish.	
It was a God-drenched speech.	
This president, who has been accused of giving too much attention to religious imagery and religious thought, has not let the criticism enter him.	
God was invoked relentlessly.	
"The Author of Liberty.""God moves and chooses as He wills.	
We have confidence because freedom is the permanent hope of mankind . . . the longing of the soul."	
Ending tyranny in the world?	
Well that's an ambition, and if you're going to have an ambition it might as well be a big one.	
But this declaration, which is not wrong by any means, seemed to me to land somewhere between dreamy and disturbing.	
Tyranny is a very bad thing and quite wicked, but one doesn't expect we're going to eradicate it any time soon.	
Again, this is not heaven, it's earth.	
This is--how else to put it?--over the top.	
It is the kind of sentence that makes you wonder if this White House did not, in the preparation period, have a case of what I have called in the past "mission inebriation."	
A sense that there are few legitimate boundaries to the desires born in the goodness of their good hearts.	
One wonders if they shouldn't ease up, calm down, breathe deep, get more securely grounded.	
The most moving speeches summon us to the cause of what is actually possible.	
Perfection in the life of man on earth is not.

read lincoln's rather short 2nd inaugural it's about as "god drenched' as you could get. way more so than bush's (god, He, the Lord, etc.) over and over and over again. considering the brevity of the speech, you could barely fit any more "god's" and such in the address without buying vowels and consonants from vanna at a 5 fer 1 speshul price. carry on, peggy whit Paul Mitchum Sun, 23 Jan 2005 03:09:45 -0800 Re: Did you miss the inaugural address ?	
To put it simply (for your benefit): Lincoln spoke *of* God, demonstrating the irony of a war fought between people with more similarities (their religious beliefs among them) than differences.	
Dubya spoke *for* God, demanding that we should all fall in line behind him, because he's got The Plan, and God's On His Side.	
Pure religious jingoism.	
My favorite part of the speech, though, is this line: You have to admire the sheer audacity of doublespeak like that.	
Especially when the list of the 'willing' just went into the circular file a few days ago.	
Bush's inaugural is an announcement that the Bush Doctrine was as much a sales pitch as the WMD justification; BushCo hasn't abandoned the neocon ideal of a Pax Americana.	
And you, mr. whit, fell for it.

I guess it's a matter of personal taste.	
Some people like Barry Manilow.	
It seems to me Bush is getting a bit pie-eyed and mystical.	
He's carrying out God's destiny to liberate mankind, and trusting in God to deliver a favorable outcome for a just cause.	
That is a fine sounding theory, but the results of Bush's policies look worse every day.

Sunni say the poll is now illegitimate because they chose not to vote.	
Fundamentally, choosing not to vote is actually a vote for the other side.	
If you choose not to vote, then you choose to give your opponents all the power.	
If the Sunni's were prevented, or restricted or otherwise not allowed to vote, then they could claim illegitimacy, but since the simply just collectively decided not to vote, then they declared the vote legitimate of their own volition whilest simultaneously ceding power to all non-Sunnis.	
If one slices off one's nose to spite their face, then nobody should be surprised about their complaints of bleeding.

The Sunni's now claim that the vote is not legitimate because they didn't vote.	
It's not their right to decide the legitimacy of the vote.	
The Sunni's had ALL the power about a year ago.	
Then they, the minority, were toppled, and they used their power to intimidate and threaten Shi'ites through the entire period.	
Who do you think the insurgents were killing -- shi'ites.

11 Feb 2005 01:45:13 -0800 Iraq Elections at this point This is getting strange.	Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-10" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
I actually can't recall it ever taking 2 weeks to "count" these many ballots, generally elections are called within 24 hours.	
In this case counting is taking 2 weeks.	
What is strange is everyone knows who won, Sistani won.	
His party, the major winner, could not field canidates until just before the election, but it was his face on all the poster and his part wipped up the heavily funded US supported government.	US PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-21" type="COUNTRY"
So we have the voice of the people of Iraq , even if the Sunni's had voted Sistani would still be the majority leader.	Iraq PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-10" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
But he was not running.	
So the US has entered in to the classic Shia quicksand of Islamic Republics, which have caused it such problems in Iran .

The problem with Sistani running Iraq is he refuses to talk to the Ameircans, and as the real power broker what ever figure heads take the PM and other posts will speak with as little authority as their counter parts in Iran .

The US is now fighting a war for a nation who government they have no direct ties with.	US PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-21" type="COUNTRY"
The other option, and what the US seems to be trying, is to somehow fudge the election so Sistani does not win, that raise doubts about the outcome, claiming fraud, do anything so that the election causes to results.	US PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-21" type="COUNTRY"

Likely only sanctions have killed more.	
Sistani has the popular support and the claim of the election which the Ameircans bungled baddly and allowed him to take over.	Ameirca PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-29" mod="S" type="COUNTRY"

Hell when the worst possible event in the election was happening, Sistani was flooding the polls with his supporters Bush was crowing.	
Sadly Bush's concerns are short-term politics in the South of Ameirca , and they have already decided they don't have to pay attention to Iraq .

I've read quite a few more rational works describing how the US was doing its best to avoid, or at the very least postpone, a war against Japan , mainly because FDR was trying to provoke Hitler to war and didn't need a distraction on another distant front. work? (stuff deleted) The thesis has been expounded by several conspiracy theorists, mainly the ones who expounded that FDR knew Pearl Harbor was about to be attacked, and let it happen.

One of their "proofs" was that the US carriers were out of port during the attack, and "everybody knew" carriers were the capital ship of the future.	US PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-17" type="COUNTRY"
However, the two carriers operating out of Pearl at the moment were sent West with light escort, on possibly intersecting routes with the IJN Kido Butai, which had far more carriers and a far heavier escort.	Pearl PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:364230" id="Pl-66" latLong="21.355°N 157.972°W" state="US-HI" type="WATER"

Consequently, for the PH conspiracy theorists to believe that FDR kept the carriers out of harm's way, we not only have to grant FDR the full knowledge of Kido Butai's route of approach would not result in either USN carrier fleet getting caught in a hopeless battle, but that FDR could psychically manipulate the weather to prevent Halsey from sailing into Pearl and thus be ambushed.

To make a very long story short, it is foolish to assume that the US wanted to go to war against Japan prior to 1941, considering the weight of evidence arguing against a US desire for war, and the overwhelming lack of evidence (not to mention rational thought) arguing for a US desire for war.

As part of the catch-up effort, she whole-heartedly entered into the Imperialist game in Asia , being treated as an equal (relative to her power) by the other powers.

 The 1860 Presidential Election	
29 Jan 2005 22:04:38 GMT The 1860 Presidential Election In 1860 there was a four-way race between the Republican Party with Abraham Lincold, the Democratic Party with Stephen Douglas, the Southern Democratic Party with John Breckenridge, and the Constitutional Union Party with John Bell.

Lincoln won a plurality with about 40% of the vote.	
WI it was only a two-way race between Lincoln and Douglas?	
I believe Douglas would have won.	
This would have delayed secession and the Civil War.

Many careless observers felt at the time that the success of Lincoln was due entirely to the fact of there having been three opposing candidates in the field; or, in other words, to the dissensions in the Democratic party, which divided its vote between Breckinridge and Douglas.	
What merely moral strength the Democratic party would have gained had it remained united, it is impossible to estimate.	
Such a supposition can only be based on the absence of the extreme Southern doctrines concerning slavery.	Southern PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" mod="S" predicative="true" type="RGN",South PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-8" mod="S" type="RGN"
Given the presence of those doctrines in the canvass, no hypothesis can furnish a result different from that which occurred.	
In the contest upon the questions as they existed, the victory of Lincoln was certain.	
If all the votes given to all the opposing candidates had been concentrated and cast for a 'fusion ticket,' as was wholly or partly done in five States, the result would have been changed nowhere except in New Jersey , California , and Oregon ; Lincoln would still have received but 11 fewer, or 169 electoral votes--majority of 35 in the entire electoral college."

Abraham Lincoln, A History, Volume 2 by John George Nicolay and John Hay See for a confirmation of the electoral arithmetic: the states where Lincoln got an abolute majority of the popular vote (i.e., all the free states except Oregon , California , and New Jersey ) were sufficient to bring him a majority in the Electoral College.

The reason that Lincoln could get an electoral majority with only forty percent of the popular vote was not that his opposition was divided but that he had far fewer "wasted" votes than his opponents--in ten southern states he got no popular votes at all.	state PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:1780796" id="Pl-14" latLong="43.000°N 75.500°W" state="US-NY" type="CIVIL"
It can of course be argued that the candidate of a united anti-Lincoln opposition might have done better than all the OTL anti-Lincoln candidates combined, because the mere fact of the divided nature of Lincoln's opposition might have discouraged anti-Lincoln men and led to fewer of them voting than would otherwise be the case.	
But given that turnout was quite high in 1860, I doubt this.	
One thing seems reasonably clear to me: if there was to be a united anti- Lincoln opposition, Douglas could not lead it.	
He was hated too much in the South for his opposition to the admission of Kansas as a state under the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution and for his interpretation of Dred Scott as still allowing territories to exclude slavery through unfriendly local legislation.

(See for Douglas's defense of his position.

 Board Member Compensation

We don't want to lose the contributions of this board member, but this has become a financial issue.	
Thanks.

You should check out the law in your state and or country.	
It is reasonable, however, to reimburse board members for legitimate and necessary expenses incurred in order to serve on the board.	
I wonder if you could make a case for paying someone to replace the board member so the board member can attend meetings.	
I'm not a lawyer, but it seems to me to be similar to reimbursing a board member for a babysitter, which no one questions.	
Another possibility is to change the meeting times.

In fairness, reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses on behalf of the organization -- including travel and lodging to attend board meetings -- are allowed.	
However, Publication 557 does not explicitly prohibit compensation to directors.	
As far as state laws go, you must follow the laws for the states (1) in which the organization is incorporated and (2) in which the organization operates.	
For an organization that is incorporated in Maryland and has its headquarters in Maryland , the laws of Maryland apply without regard to the states in which the directors live.	Maryland PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1715934" id="Pl-5" latLong="39.000°N 76.750°W" state="MD" type="CIVIL"

Thus, the laws applying to the corporate person are the laws of the state where that person "lives".

Got job?	 
And so, I have rejoined the world of the fully employed.	 
After Christmas, I got a call from the wife of one of my former bosses (at my last full-time job).	 
She was looking for a Development Assistant at the retirement community where she works.	 
I started here 4 weeks ago.	 
WM is affiliated with, but not run or fully supported by, the denomination I've been a part of all my life (UMC).	 
My grandmother (who was Baptist) lived here for a few months before she died in 1995, so I have many connections to the job.	 
Our offices are in one of the patio homes , and I have my own lovely office with a window.	 
The job's only about 12 miles from home , and I'm going against the bulk of the traffic mornings and afternoons.	 
It all seems perfect and yet.	 
.. yet..	 
. yet...	 
Oh, I'm so thankful to be somewhere so nice where I might actually make a difference in people's lives, and I want to keep an open mind and hope it'll last forever, but I have a feeling I'll be restless within a year or so.	 
My boss is a very nice person, but conservative and resistant to technology, i.e. computers, internet, etc.	 
We just got new computers a week and half ago, and she's griping about XP (her old OS was Windows 98--mine was 95, so I'm thrilled with the new stuff).	 
I tell her it'll just take some getting used to.	 
We'll see.	 
I'm not making the kind of salary I was hoping to get, but it's the best salary I've gotten thus far.	 
When I was fulltime in radio I made a little less, but I got quite a few remotes, which make up for not getting a topnotch salary.	 
I'm still doing my TV announcing and my weekend radio stuff, so that money will help.	 
I'm going to start actively pursuing more voice work in the next month or so, too.	 
My plan is to pay off my car early, and then work on the other debts.	 
I think it's time to go on and fill out the adoption applications.	 
I'm terrified of more debt, but Mom and Dad will help with the money.	 
I'm not sure they realize how expensive it all is.	 
I'm thinking we might lean toward adopting from Guatemala , but we've still not hashed it all out.	 ,Guatemala PLACE country="GT" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18864178" id="Pl-1" latLong="15.500°N 90.250°W" type="COUNTRY"
It's almost bad making some money now, because while most of me wants to save as much as possible, the other, smaller part is screaming loudly for stuff, stuff, stuff!!!	 
I've got a trial subscription to XM at work because of the Dell computers, and now I'm lusting to have it all of the time.	 
G got me a nice office stereo for my birthday and it does have an aux jack, so I could listen to it here.	 
He asked if I wanted a car stereo, and I said no, but I do.	 
There are so many things I want.	 
A garage .	 
A dining room set.	 
New stuff for our house . New clothes.	 
New everything.	 
But I want family more.	 
I think part of the draw of the other stuff is I could get it now.	 
But I'd be paying for it later.	 
Money makes the world go round and round and round til I'm just dizzy.

My understanding of the ruling and history of the case from reading the article goes like this: Trial judge says M can have access to video monitored interviews of al-Q captives.	
Government says, "No way Jose as it threatens national security."	
Judge says, "Fine, then you dont get to have the death penalty and there can be no mention of 9-11."	
Appeals Court says, "Hold on judgy-wudgy, we think you went too far.	
The gummit can indeed protect national security by barring direct contact with witnesses and we are putting their full case plus the death penalty back in action.	
However, M does have a right to use information favorable to his case, so you best draw up some summaries of the witnesses' statements."	
Judge says, "Okay, but I will want to see what conditions and treatments these witnesses received while under interrogation."

 Sinn Fein IRA?	
Wed, 9 Mar 2005 09:12:14 +0000 Sinn Fein IRA?	
There are two logical positions to hold on Sinn Fein and the IRA. 1.	
One accepts Sinn Fein's claim that they are not connected to the IRA.	
In that case, there is no point in a British government dealing with Sinn Fein as the primary conduit to peace because they have no special influence in the matter.	British PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-3" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
2. One accepts that Sinn Fein are the IRA.	
In which case a British Government should never deal with them because it means, at the least, that the likes of Gerry Adams must be guilty of conspiracy to murder, maim, bomb, rob and extort . Appeasing criminals never works, it merely puts off the evil day.	British PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-3" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
The truth is that militant republicanism in Ireland will never accept disarmament.	
The names of the organisations may change - IRA, PIRA, Real IRA etc - but the impulse to terrorist acts will not.

I got the impression that there are a number of people in what people generally describe as "Ireland" who want to have no official link with the UK or it's government - most of them seem happy to just vote for it, but some are moved to take up arms to remove what they see as the interference of a foreign power.

Perhaps some members, supporters and voters of Sinn Fein are also members of the IRA.	
But it's not as simple as saying that Sinn Fein is the IRA because it simply isn't true.	
Gerry Adams hasn't been convicted of murder, robbery, extortion etc, although he was once held in prison without a trial, which is an interesting precursor to the current governments attempts to do away with the Magna Carta.	
Many sane people would conclude that there's no need to disarm the IRA as they appear to be perfectly capable of keeping their word on a ceasefire while a political path is followed.	
Surely if they have some innate desire to kill, maim, bomb etc they've have been doing it regardless of any political process?	
To what do you attribute their current abstinance?	
Surely if you're a Sinn Fein leader you'd be funded the same as the leader of any other party?

Presidential Chief of Staff Rigoberto Tiglao said Estrada's camp was trying to revive the issue on the legality of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo's administration when this was upheld twice by the Supreme Court.	
"This is an old tune as far as the Palace is concerned," Tiglao said hours after Estrada petitioned the anti-graft court, the Sandiganbayan, to dismiss the government charges against him, citing "lack of jurisdiction" since he was still the president.	
Meanwhile, the court shrugged off the claim of Estrada's lawyer Alan Paguia that its ruling on the legitimacy of the Arroyo administration was illegal and cautioned that the tribunal's decision was final and could not be overturned by the Sandiganbayan.	
The Sandiganbayan Special Division Friday reset for June 16 the resumption of Estrada's plunder case hearing, which was originally scheduled for June 2.

The decision was made in response to the recommendation of Prime Minister Vladimir Spidla.	
Kostelka, 52, was first deputy defense minister and an ex- general.	
At the end of last month, Tvrdik submitted his resignation in protest against planned cuts in defense spending as part of the government's finance reforms.	
Under the planned package of public finance reforms, only 2.05 percent of the country 's gross domestic product (GDP) will be allocated for the defense budget.	country PLACE country="CZ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:19456509" id="Pl-5" latLong="49.750°N 15.000°E" type="COUNTRY"
Tvrdik said the military reform could not be completed thoroughly with so little money.	
Tvrdik, who took over the defense ministry in May 2001, also announced that he would quit his post in the parliament and give up his position in the ruling party Social Democrats.	
Prime Minister Spidla said Monday that the ongoing military reform should continue, with regard to the government's planned public finance reforms.	
The appointment marked the second change of the cabinet post since the Spidla-led government came into power in July 2002.

Waksal was also ordered to pay more than 4 million dollars in fines and back taxes.

Before the sentence, there had been speculations among analysts on whether Waksal would get leniency because his company has been working on researches of cancer drugs, a good endeavor in the eyes of many people.	
ImClone's Erbitux drug has been recently accepted to be effective in helping cancer patients.	
But the order just released from the courthouse in New York has obviously separated Waksal's good efforts in making new drugs from his legal problems.

Amid the financial storms last year and the ensuing cracking down on corporate malfeasance, Waksal pleaded guilty in October to charges involving his efforts to sell a huge block of his company' s stock in late 2001.	
The attempt to sell the shares were just before ImClone shares plunged on the news that the Food and Drug Administration rejected ImClone's application to sell the experimental cancer drug, Erbitux.	
This incident then triggered legal investigations, which also included the case of a US media and domestic design diva, Martha Stewart.	US PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY"
